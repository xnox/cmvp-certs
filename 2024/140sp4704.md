Note: The part number for Tamper Evidence Label (TEL) can be found in section Physical security of this document.

Modes of operation
By default, the module is delivered with a non-Approved mode of operation but supports an Approved mode of operation.
Once the module is configured to operate in the Approved mode of operation by following the steps in section "Secure
Operation" of this document by the Crypto Officer, the module can only operate in the Approved mode. The module does
not claim implementation of a degraded mode of operation.

The tables below list all Approved or Vendor-affirmed security functions of the module, including specific key size(s) (in bits
unless noted otherwise) employed for Approved services, and implemented modes of operation. There are some algorithm
modes that were tested but not implemented by the module. Only the algorithms, modes, and key sizes that are
implemented by the module are shown in these tables.

Notes:

●  There are some algorithm modes that were tested but not implemented by the module. Only the algorithms, modes,

and key sizes that are implemented by the module are shown in these tables.

●  The module’s AES-GCM implementation conforms to IG C.H scenario #1 following RFC 5288 for TLS.  The module is
compatible with TLSv1.2 and provides support for the acceptable GCM cipher suites from SP 800-52 Rev1, Section

3.3.1. The operations of one of the two parties involved in the TLS key establishment scheme were performed
entirely within the cryptographic boundary of the module being validated. The counter portion of the IV is set by the
module within its cryptographic boundary. When the IV exhausts the maximum number of possible values for a
given session key, the first party, client or server, to encounter this condition will trigger a handshake to establish a
new encryption key. In case the module’s power is lost and then restored, a new key for use with the AES GCM
encryption/decryption shall be established.

●  No parts of the SSH, TLS, SNMP and IKE protocols, other than the KDFs, have been tested by the CAVP and CMVP.

As the module can only be operated in the Approved mode of operation, and any algorithms not listed in the tables 3-8
above will be rejected by the module while in the approved mode, the tables defined in SP800-140B for the following
categories are missing from this document.

●  Non-Approved Algorithms Allowed in Approved Mode of Operation
●  Non-Approved Algorithms Allowed in Approved Mode of Operation with No Security Claimed
●  Non-Approved Algorithms Not Allowed in Approved Mode of Operation

Cryptographic Module Interfaces
The module provides a number of physical and logical interfaces to the device, and the physical interfaces provided by the
module are mapped to the following FIPS 140-3 defined logical interfaces: data input, data output, control input, control
output (N/A), status output, and power. The logical interfaces and their mapping are described in the following table.

Authentication Strength
The security modules support public-key based authentication using a
minimum of RSA 2048 bits.

User

ECDSA

User

Password/Pre-shared Secret

The minimum equivalent strength supported is 112 bits.  The probability that a
random attempt will succeed is 1/(2^112) which is less than 1/1,000,000.
The probability of successfully authenticating to the module within a one
minute period is 1,020,000/(2^112), which is less than 1/100,000.  The
module at its highest can support at most 17,000 new sessions per second to
authenticate in a one-minute period.
When configuring the smallest curve P-256, the probability that a random
attempt will succeed, or a false acceptance will occur is 1/2^128, which is less
than 1/1,000,000.  17,000 attempts are allowed in a one-minute period.
Therefore, the probability of a random success in a one-minute period is
1,020,000/2^128, which is less than 1/100,000.
The minimum length is eight (8) characters (94 possible characters). The
probability that a random attempt will succeed or a false acceptance will occur
is 1/(94^8) which is less than 1/1,000,000.  The probability of successfully
authenticating to the module within one minute is 3/(94^8), which is less than
1/100,000.  The configuration supports at most 3 failed attempts to
authenticate in a one-minute period. This calculation is based on the
assumption that the typical standard American QWERTY computer keyboard
has 10 Integer digits, 52 alphabetic characters, and 32 special characters
providing 94 characters to choose from in total.

G = Generate: The module generates or derives the SSP.

R = Read: The SSP is read from the module (e.g., the SSP is output).

W = Write: The SSP is updated, imported, or written to the module.

E = Execute: The module uses the SSP in performing a cryptographic operation.

Z = Zeroise: The module zeroizes the SSP.

Unauthenticated Services
Unauthenticated Users can run the self-test service by power-cycling the module by removing the power and re-applying.

Software/Firmware Security
Integrity Techniques

The module performs the Firmware Integrity test by using HMAC-SHA2-256 (HMAC Cert. #A2385) during the Pre-
Operational Self-Test. A Firmware Integrity Test Key (non-SSP) was preloaded to the module’s binary at the factory and
used for firmware integrity test only at the pre-operational self-test. At Module’s initialization, the integrity of the runtime
executable is verified using an HMAC-SHA2-256 digest which is compared to a value computed at build time. If at the load
time the MAC does not match the stored, known MAC value, the module would enter to an Error state with all crypto
functionality inhibited.

The module also supports the firmware load test by using RSA 2048 bits with SHA2-256 (RSA Cert. #A2385) for the new
validated firmware to be uploaded into the module. A Firmware Load Test Key (non-SSP) was preloaded to the module’s
binary at the factory and used for firmware load test. In order to load new firmware, the Crypto Officer must authenticate
into the module before loading any firmware.  This ensures that unauthorized access and use of the module is not
performed. The module will load the new update upon reboot. The update attempt will be rejected if the verification fails.

Integrity Test On-Demand
Integrity test is performed as part of the Pre-Operational Self-Tests.  It is automatically executed at power-on. The
operator can power-cycle or reboot the module to initiate the software integrity test on-demand. This automatically
performs the integrity test of all firmware components included within the boundary of the module.

Operational Environment
The FIPS 140-3 Operational Environment requirements are not applicable as the module is not operated in a modifiable
operational environment. The operational environment is limited as the modules include a firmware load service to support
necessary updates. New firmware versions within the scope of this validation must be validated through the FIPS 140-3
CMVP. Any other firmware loaded into these modules is out of the scope of this validation and requires a separate FIPS
140-3 validation.

ION 9000 FIPS Kit: P/N 920-000311

If additional labels are needed, the CO will need to contact Palo Alto Networks.

ION 1200, ION 1200-C-NA, ION 1200-C-ROW, and ION 1200-C-5G-WW Physical Security
The following section demonstrates how to apply the tamper evident labels (TELs) to the ION 1200 module.  The enclosure
of the modules is the same.

The tamper evident labels shall be installed on the security devices containing the module prior to operating in the
Approved mode.  TELs shall be applied as depicted in the figures below.  Any unused TELs must be securely stored,
accounted for, and maintained by the CO in a protected location.

Should the CO have to remove, change or replace TELs (tamper-evidence labels) for any reason, the CO must examine the
location from which the TEL was removed and ensure that no residual debris is still remaining on the chassis or card.  If
residual debris remains, the CO must remove the debris using a damp cloth.

Any deviation of the TELs placement by unauthorized operators such as tearing, misconfiguration, removal, change,
replacement or any other change in the TELs from its original configuration as depicted below shall mean the module is no
longer in the Approved mode of operation.  Returning the system back to the Approved mode of operation requires the
replacement of the TELs as depicted below and any additional requirement per the site security policy which are out of
scope of this Security Policy.

The ION 1200 requires 3 tamper evident labels while the ION 1200-C-NA/ION 1200-C-ROW/ION 1200-C-5G-WW
require 4 tamper evident labels.  The figures below detail the location of the labels.

Algorithm
SP 800-90B Health Tests

Self-Test Details
The module’s entropy source implements Start-up and Continuous health
tests defined in SP800-90B, section 4.2. The entropy source utilizes
Developer-Defined Alternatives to the Continuous Health Tests which is
defined in SP 800-90B section 4.5.

Error Handling

Table 27 - Entropy Source Health Tests

If any of the above-mentioned self-tests fail, the module reports the cause of the error and enters an error state (there is
only one error state). In the Error State, no cryptographic services are provided, and data output is prohibited. The only
method to recover from the error state is to reboot the module and perform the self-tests, including the pre-operational
software integrity test and the conditional CASTs. The module will only enter into the operational state after successfully
passing the pre-operational firmware integrity test and the conditional CASTs. The table below shows the different causes
that lead to the Error State and the status indicators reported.

Cause of Error

Life-Cycle Assurance
All ION devices are designed to handle the various stages of a module’s life-cycle.  The sections below highlight the details
for each stage.

Secure Delivery Procedures
The security of the module is maintained during the transfer of these products from production sites to the customer
through the following mechanisms:

●  Email from Palo Alto Networks, Inc. confirming the order and includes tracking number(s). When the package

arrives at the customer site, the customer checks the tracking number on the package with the tracking number
supplied by Palo Alto Networks, Inc.

●  The customer also checks the integrity of the package by inspecting the integrity of the security tape and the seals

of the package for tampering

●  The hardware and applicable documentation are delivered in the same package

Secure Operation
The module meets all the Level 2 requirements for FIPS 140-3, and only includes an Approved mode of operation.  Once
the module has been received, the Crypto Officer shall follow the secure operations provided below to place the module in
the Approved mode. The module runs firmware version 5.6.3.  This is the only allowable firmware image for this current
Approved mode of operation. The module is initiated into the Approved mode of operation via the following procedure:

1.  The Crypto Officer must apply tamper evidence labels as described in Section “Physical Security” of this document
2.  Power on the ION device
3.  Using the Controller, navigate to the device that is to be initiated

a.  Note: The module authenticates the Crypto Officer using default authentication (Root CA), and then

replaces the default information with a specific one from the Controller

4.  Click the three bullets next to the device
5.  Select “FIPS”

a.  Click “proceed” to begin initialization procedure
6.  The module will begin initialization that includes the following:
a.  Zeroization of any sensitive information or data
b.  Power cycle of the device followed by running all self-tests

7.  Once initialization is complete, the module displays the following status output:

a.  Device Mode: “fips”
b.  Self-tests: “Power-up self-test successful”

Once the module has completed initialization into the Approved mode of operation, the module automatically enforces a
password change for the Crypto Officer.  Any non-approved configurations/algorithms are rejected automatically by the
module and an error message is output.

The Crypto Officer shall load the FIPS 140-3 validated firmware only to maintain validation.

End of Life / Sanitization
End of life dates for software and hardware modules are announced publicly via Palo Alto Networks’ services website.
Crypto Officers should follow the procedure below for the secure destruction of their module:

(ION) Devices ION 1200 and ION 9000

© 2024 Palo Alto Networks, Inc.

Note: This process will cause the module to no longer function after it has wiped all configurations and keys.

1.  Access the module via SSH with Crypto Officer
2.  Authenticate using proper credentials
3.  Execute command: “disable system”
a.  Confirm command

4.  Module will begin zeroization process and wipe all security parameters and configurations within the module’s

boundary
