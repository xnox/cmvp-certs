1.  General

1.1.  Scope

This document specifies the security policy for Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. (“Samsung”) SSD NVMe TCG Opal SSC

SEDs PM1733a/PM1735a Series, herein after referred to as a “cryptographic module” or “module”, SSD (Solid State
Drive), satisfies all applicable FIPS 140-3 Security Level 2 requirements of a hardware module, supporting TCG Opal SSC
based SED (Self-Encrypting Drive) features, designed to protect unauthorized access to the user data stored in its NAND
flash memories. The built-in AES hardware engines in the cryptographic module’s controller provide on-the-fly encryption
and decryption of the user data without performance loss. The SED’s nature also provides instantaneous sanitization of
the user data via cryptographic erase.

This module provides the role-based authentication. The authentication mechanism allows a minimum 8-byte length or
longer (up to 32-byte) Password, where each byte can be any of 0x00 to 0xFF, for every Cryptographic Officer and User role
supported by the module, which means a single random attempt can succeed with the probability of 1/264 or lower. Each
Password authentication attempt takes at least 750ms. It means, the number of attempts possible in a minute period is
maximum 80 attempts (60000ms/750ms).

5  The module only supports approved services in an approved manner. The module uses implicit indicators through the result of the NVMe or
TCG commands.
6  The cryptographic module shows the hardware version and firmware version through the ‘Model Number (MN)’ and ‘Firmware Revision (FR)’
of Identify Controller Data Structure. If the module enters the FIPS Fail Mode, this service indicates “ERRORMOD” in Firmware Revision (FR).
7  The I/O command itself is the approved service where Self-Initiated Cryptographic Output Capability occurs, while the unlock request (via
Lock/Unlock an LBA range” service) is the authorized enablement of this capability.
8  This service is exempted from being authenticated by exception clause (c) of IG 4.1.A.

6.  Operational Environment

-

-

The cryptographic module operates in a  limited  operational environment  that  is  consist  of the module’s firmware.  This
operational environment does not require any specific security rules, settings, configurations or restrictions to be set.

The cryptographic module does not provide any general-purpose operating system to the operator.

-  Unauthorized  modification  of  the  firmware  is  prevented  by  the  pre-operational  firmware  integrity  test  and  conditional

firmware load test.

7.  Physical Security

The following physical security mechanisms are implemented in a cryptographic module:

•

•

•

The module consists of production-grade components enclosed in an aluminum alloy enclosure, which is opaque
within the visible spectrum. The top panel of the enclosure can be removed by unscrewing screws. However, the
module is sealed with tamper-evident labels in accordance with FIPS 140-3 Level 2 Physical Security requirements so
that tampering is easily detected when the top and bottom cases are detached.
2 tamper-evident labels are applied over both top and bottom cases of the module at the factory. The tamper-evident
labels are not removed and reapplied without tamper evidence.
The tamper-evident labels are applied by Samsung at Manufacturing.

The following table summarizes the actions required by the Cryptographic Officer Role to ensure that physical security is

maintained:

The cryptographic module operates always in Approved Mode once shipped from the vendor's manufacturing site.
The steps necessary for the secure installation, initialization and start-up of the cryptographic module as per FIPS 140-3
VE11.33.01 are as follows:

11.1.  Secure Installation

•

•

•

•

-

[Step1] User should examine the tamper evidence.

-

Inspect the entire perimeter for cracks, gouges, lack of screw(s) and other signs of tampering including the tamper
evident sealing label.

If there is any sign of tampering, do not use the product and contact Samsung.

-
[Step2] Identify the firmware version in the device.

-

Confirm that the firmware version is equivalent to the version(s) listed in this document via NVM express Identify
Controller command.

[Step3] Take the drive’s ownership.

-

Change SID’s PIN by setting a new PIN.

Activate the Locking SP by using the Activate method.

-
Note: If required to enable the additional Admin authorities in Locking SP, new PINs must be set by the Cryptographic
Officer.
[Step4] Periodically examine the tamper evidence

If there is any sign of tampering, stop using the product to avoid potential security hazards or information leakage.

11.2.  Operational Description of Module

•

The cryptographic module shall maintain logical separation of data input, data output, control input, control output,
and power.
The cryptographic module shall not output CSPs in any form.
The cryptographic module shall use the Approved DRBG for generating all cryptographic keys.
The cryptographic module shall enforce a limited operational environment by the secure firmware load test using RSA
PSS-3072 with SHA-256.
The cryptographic module shall provide a production-grade cryptographic boundary.
The cryptographic module enters the error state upon failure of self-tests. most commands except for supported
command from the Host (General Purpose Computer (GPC) outside the cryptographic boundary) are rejected in the
error state and the IO command returns Namespace Not Ready (SC=0x82, SCT=0x0), the other commands return
Internal Error (SC=0x6, SCT=0x0) defined in NVMe specification via the status output. Cryptographic services and data
output are explicitly inhibited when in the error state. When module fails firmware integrity checks performed by Mask
ROM, the module will fail to boot; module will not service any requests or provide any status output (module hangs).
The cryptographic module satisfies the requirements of FIPS 140-3 IG C.I (i.e. key_1 ≠ key_2).
The module generates at a minimum 256 bits of entropy for use in key generation.
Bypass capability is not applicable to the cryptographic module.
Critical functions are not applicable to the cryptographic module.
The module generates symmetric keys which are unmodified outputs from the DRBG.
If you require the “Samsung SED Product Manual”, kindly reach out to the vendor contact information that is posted in
certification.
