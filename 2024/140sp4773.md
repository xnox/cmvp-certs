PAN-OS 11.0 VM-Series Security Policy 2

1. General
The PAN-OS 11.0 VM-Series module is available in multiple capacity options. All models can be deployed as guest virtual
machines on VMware ESXi, Hyper-V, and Linux server that is running the KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) using a
common base image distributed in a compatible hypervisor format.

The PAN-OS VM-Series is the virtualized form factor of the Palo Alto Networks next-generation ﬁrewall. The VM-Series is
used to protect applications/data from cyber threats using Palo Alto Networks’ next-generation ﬁrewall and advanced threat
prevention features.

For purposes of this validation, the exact software version of the module tested was 11.0.3-h12. The cryptographic module
meets the overall requirements applicable to Level 1 security of FIPS 140-3.

Operator Porting Rules
The CMVP allows user porting of a validated software module to an operational environment which was not included as part
of the validation testing. An operator may install and run a VM-series ﬁrewall on any general purpose computer (GPC) or
platform using the speciﬁed hypervisor and operating system on the validation certiﬁcate or other compatible operating
and/or hypervisor system and afﬁrm the modules continued FIPS 140-3 validation compliance.

The CMVP makes no statement as to the correct operation of the module or the security strengths of the generated keys
when ported and executed in an operational environment not listed on the validation certiﬁcate.

Approved Mode of Operation
The following procedure will put the module into the Approved mode of operation:

● During initial boot up, break the boot sequence via the console port connection (by entering “maint”) to access

the main menu.
● Select “Continue.”
● Select the “Set FIPS-CC Mode” option to enter the Approved mode.
● Select “Enable FIPS-CC Mode”.
● When prompted, select “Reboot” and the module will re-initialize and continue into “FIPS-CC” mode (Approved

mode).

● The module will reboot.
● In “FIPS-CC” mode, the console port is available only as a status output port.
● Once the module has ﬁnished booting, the Crypto Ofﬁcer can authenticate using the default credentials that

come with the module

o Once authenticated, the module will automatically require the operator to change their password; and

the default credential is overwritten

The module will automatically indicate the Approved mode of operation in the following manner:

● Status output interface will indicate “**** FIPS-CC MODE ENABLED ****” via the CLI session.
● Status output interface will indicate “FIPS-CC mode enabled successfully” via the console port.
● The module will display “FIPS-CC” at all times in the status bar at the bottom of the web interface.

Should one or more power-up self-tests fail, the Approved mode of operation will not be achieved. Feedback will consist of:

● The module will reboot and enter a state in which the reason for the reboot can be determined.
● The module will output “FIPS-CC failure.”
● To determine which self-test caused the system to reboot into the error state, connect the console cable and

follow the on-screen instructions to view the self-test output.

PAN-OS 11.0 VM-Series Security Policy 4

Note: Disabling “FIPS-CC” mode causes a complete factory reset, which is described in the Zeroization section below.

Non-Compliant State

Failure to follow the directions in the Approved Mode of Operation above or rules noted in Section 11 will result in the
module operating in a non-compliant state, which is considered out of scope of this validation.

Zeroization
To perform the zeroization service, follow the procedure below:

● Access the module’s CLI via SSH, and command the module to enter maintenance mode; the module will

reboot

o Note: Establish a serial connection to the console port

● After reboot, select “Continue.”
● Select “Factory Reset.”
● The module will perform a zeroization, and provide the following message once complete:

o

“Factory Reset Status: Success”

Approved and Allowed Algorithms
The cryptographic modules support the following Approved algorithms. Only the algorithms, modes, and key sizes speciﬁed
in this table are used by the module. The CAVP certiﬁcate may contain more tested options than listed in this table.

● For TLS, The GCM implementation meets Scenario 1 of IG C.H: it is used in a manner compliant with SP 800-52
and in accordance with Section 4 of RFC 5288 for TLS key establishment, and ensures when the nonce_explicit

part of the IV exhausts all possible values for a given session key, that a new TLS handshake is initiated per
sections 7.4.1.1 and 7.4.1.2 of RFC 5246. During operational testing, the module was tested against an
independent version of TLS and found to behave correctly.

o From this RFC 5288, the GCM cipher suites in use are
TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256,
TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384,
TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256, and
TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384

● For IPsec/IKEv2, The GCM implementation meets Scenario 1 of IG C.H: it is used in a manner compliant with
RFCs 4106 and 7296 (RFC 5282 is not applicable, as the module does not use GCM within IKEv2 itself), and
ensures when the module exhausts all possible values for a given session key that this triggers a rekey condition.
During operational testing, the module was tested against an independent version of IPsec with IKEv2 and found
to behave correctly.

● For SSH, the module meets Scenario 1 of IG C.H. The module conforms to RFCs 4252, 4253, and 5647. The ﬁxed
ﬁeld is 32 bits in length and is derived using the SSH KDF; this ensures the ﬁxed ﬁeld is unique for any given GCM
session. The invocation ﬁeld is 64 bits in length and is incremented for each invocation of GCM; this prevents the
IV from repeating until the entire invocation ﬁeld space of 264 is exhausted, which can take hundreds of years. (In
FIPS-CC Mode, SSH rekey is automatically conﬁgured at 1 GB of data or 1 hour, whichever comes ﬁrst.)

In all the above cases, the nonce_explicit is always generated deterministically. AES GCM keys are zeroized when the module
is power-cycled. For each new TLS or SSH session, a new AES GCM key is established.

The module is compliant to IG C.F:

The module utilizes Approved modulus sizes 2048, 3072, and 4096 bits for RSA signatures. This functionality has been CAVP
tested as noted above. The minimum number of Miller Rabin tests for each modulus size is implemented according to Table
C.2 of FIPS 186-4. For modulus size 4096, the module implements the largest number of Miller-Rabin tests shown in Table
C.2. RSA SigVer is CAVP tested for all three supported modulus sizes as noted above. The module does not perform FIPS
186-2 SigVer. All supported modulus sizes are CAVP testable and tested as noted above. The module does not implement
RSA key transport in the approved mode.

The module does not have any algorithms that fall under:

- Non-Approved Algorithms Allowed in the Approved Mode of Operation
- Non-Approved Algorithms Allowed in the Approved Mode of Operation with No Security Claimed
- Non-Approved Algorithms Not Allowed in the Approved Mode of Operation

Cryptographic Boundary
The PAN-OS 11.0 VM-Series is a software cryptographic module and requires an underlying general purpose computer
(GPC) environment. The module consists of a GPC (multi-chip standalone embodiment) with the cryptographic boundary
deﬁned below. The cryptographic boundary (CB) includes all of the software components of the module, which is included in
the ﬁle name in Section 11 (PanOS_vm-11.0.3-h12) and also the conﬁguration ﬁle that resides on the virtual machine’s virtual
disk. The physical perimeter (PP) is deﬁned by the enclosure around the host GPC on which it runs. Figure 1 depicts the
boundary and illustrates the hardware components of a GPC.

Figure 1 - Cryptographic Boundary

3. Cryptographic Module Interfaces
The module is a software only module that operates on a general purpose computing (GPC) platform. The physical ports and
logical interfaces are consistent with a GPC operating environment. The module supports the following FIPS 140-3 logical
interfaces:

The module’s physical and electrical characteristics, manual controls, and physical indicators are provided by the host GPC;
the hypervisors provide virtualized ports and interfaces which map to the GPCs’ physical ports and interfaces (i.e., network
interfaces and GPC inputs/outputs).

4. Roles, Services, and Authentication

Roles and Services
While in the Approved mode of operation, all CO and User services are accessed via SSH or TLS sessions. Approved and

The zeroization procedure is invoked when the operator initiates the service. The operator must be in control of the module
during the entire procedure to ensure that it has successfully completed. During the zeroization procedure, no other
services are available.

Note: Additional information on the conﬁguration options the module provides can be found at
https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/

Assumption of Roles
The modules support four distinct operator roles, User and Cryptographic Ofﬁcer (CO), Remote Access VPN, and Site-to-site
VPN. The cryptographic modules enforce the separation of roles using unique authentication credentials associated with
operator accounts.

The modules do not provide a maintenance role or bypass capability.

The modules all support the use of a password (i.e. Memorized Secret as per SP 800-140E). Upon ﬁrst boot, the module
requires that the Cryptographic Ofﬁcer change the password from the default one to a custom one. The module
automatically enforces a minimum password length of at least 8 characters. In “FIPS-CC” mode, the module automatically
enforces a maximum of 10 failed attempts. Passwords stored in the module are hashed using SHA-256, and any passwords
that are transported into/out of the module are protected via TLS 1.2.

than 1/1,000,000. The probability of
successfully authenticating to the module
within one minute is 10/(958), which is less
than 1/100,000. The ﬁrewall’s conﬁguration
supports at most ten failed attempts to
authenticate in a one-minute period.

Certiﬁcate/Public key-based
The security modules support public-key
based authentication using RSA 2048 and
certiﬁcate-based authentication using RSA
2048, RSA 3072, RSA 4096, ECDSA P-256,
P-384, or P-521.

The minimum equivalent strength supported
is 112 bits. The probability that a random
attempt will succeed is 1/(2112) which is less
than 1/1,000,000. The probability of

Passwords are securely stored hashed with salt value, with very restricted access control, and rate limiting mechanism for
authentication attempts.

successfully authenticating to the module
within a one minute period is
60,000,000/(2112), which is less than
1/100,000. The ﬁrewall supports at most
60,000,000 new sessions per second to
authenticate in a one-minute period.
The pre-shared key authentication method
has a minimum security strength2 of 956. The
probability of successfully authenticating to
the module is 1/(956), which is less than
1/1,000,000. The number of authentication
attempts is limited by the number of new
connections per second supported (120,000)
on the fastest platform of the Palo Alto
Networks ﬁrewalls. The probability of
successfully authenticating to the module
within a one minute period is
7,200,000/(956), which is less than
1/100,000.

The security modules support public-key
based authentication using RSA 2048 and
certiﬁcate-based authentication using RSA
2048, RSA 3072, RSA 4096, ECDSA P-256,
P-384, or P-521.

The minimum equivalent strength supported
is 112 bits. The probability that a random
attempt will succeed is 1/(2112) which is less
than 1/1,000,000. The probability of
successfully authenticating to the module
within a one minute period is
60,000,000/(2112), which is less than
1/100,000. The ﬁrewall supports at most
60,000,000 new sessions per second to
authenticate in a one-minute period.

Deﬁnition of CSPs Modes of Access
The following table deﬁnes the relationship between access to CSPs and the different module services. The modes of access
shown in the table are deﬁned as:

2 Note: The security strength (956) is based on the use of ASCII characters that are utilized, which surpasses the 6 character
random number password allowance that sets a baseline minimum acceptable strength of 106.

G = Generate: The module generates or derives the SSP.

R = Read: The SSP is read from the module (e.g. the SSP is output).

W = Write: The SSP is updated, imported, or written to the module.

E = Execute: The module uses the SSP in performing a cryptographic operation.

Z = Zeroise: The module zeroises the SSP.

Note: Conﬁguration/System Logs for Approved services above will indicate FIPS-CC mode is enabled, conﬁguration requirements from Section 11 are
followed, and that the service succeeded.

5. Software/Firmware Security
The module performs the Software Integrity test by using HMAC-SHA-256 (HMAC Cert. #A3454) during the
Pre-Operational Self-Test. In addition, the module also conducts a software load test by using the Public Veriﬁcation Key
(RSA 2048 with SHA-256, Cert. #A3454) for the new validated software to be uploaded into the module.

Any software loaded into this module that is not shown on the module certiﬁcate is out of scope of this validation, and
requires a separate FIPS 140-3 validation.

6. Operational Environment
The module is a modiﬁable operational environment as per FIPS 140-3 Level 1 speciﬁcations. The hypervisor environment
provides an isolated operating environment and is the single operator of the virtual machine.

The tested operating environments isolate virtual systems into separate isolated process spaces. Each process space is
logically separated from all other processes by the operating environments software and hardware. The module functions
entirely within the process space of the isolated system as managed by the single operational environment. This implicitly
meets the FIPS 140-3 requirement that only one (1) entity at a time can use the cryptographic module.

7. Physical Security
There are no applicable FIPS 140-3 physical security requirements.

11. Life-Cycle Assurance
The vendor provided life-cycle assurance documentation describes conﬁguration management, design, ﬁnite state model,
development, testing, delivery & operation, end of life procedures, and guidance. For details regarding the approved mode of
operation, see “Approved Mode of Operation''. For details regarding secure installation, initialization, startup, and operation
of the module, see below.

Installation Instructions
The module can be retrieved by downloading PanOS_vm-11.0.3-h12 from the support site:
https://support.paloaltonetworks.com/Support/Index, and a checksum (SHA-256) is available to ensure the module is
correct:

Palo Alto Network provides an Administrator Guide for additional information noted in the “Reference Documents” section
of this Security Policy.

The module design corresponds to the module security rules noted in the section below.

Module Enforced Security Rules
This section documents the security rules enforced by the cryptographic module to implement the security requirements of
this FIPS 140-3 Level 1 module.

1. The cryptographic module provides four distinct operator roles. These are the User role, Remote Access VPN role,

Site-to-site VPN role, and the Cryptographic Ofﬁcer role.

2. The cryptographic module provides identity-based authentication.
3. The cryptographic module clears previous authentications when a power cycle is performed.
4.

If the cryptographic module remains inactive in any valid role for the administrator speciﬁed time interval, the
module will automatically log out the operator. The CO will conﬁgure the period of inactivity.

5. When the module has not been placed in a valid role, the operator does not have access to any cryptographic

services.

6. The operator can command the module to perform the power-up self-test by cycling power of the module.
7. Power-up self-tests do not require any operator action.
8. Data output is inhibited during power-up self-tests, zeroization, and error states.
9. Status information does not contain CSPs or sensitive data that if misused could lead to a compromise of the module.
10. There are no restrictions on which keys or CSPs are zeroized by the zeroization service.
11. The module does not support a maintenance interface or role.
12. The module does not have any external input/output devices used for entry/output of data.
13. The module does not enter or output plaintext CSPs.

© 2024 Palo Alto Networks, Inc.

PAN-OS 11.0 VM-Series Security Policy 23

14. The module does not output intermediate key generation values.
15. Pre-shared keys used for IKE/IPsec must be at least 6 bytes in length, but no more than 255 bytes.

Vendor Imposed Security Rules
In FIPS-CC mode, the following rules shall apply:

1. The operator should not enable TLSv1.0 or use RSA for key wrapping; it is disabled by default.

a. Checked via CLI using “show shared” command
2. The operator should not enable TLSv1.3, it is disabled by default.
a. Checked via CLI using “show proﬁles” command

3.

If using RADIUS, it must be conﬁgured using TLS.

a. Checked via CLI using “show shared” command

4.

If using TACACS+, conﬁgure the service route via an IPSec tunnel, and ensure the TACACS+ server is conﬁgured for
a minimum password length of eight (8) characters or greater.
a. Checked via CLI using “show deviceconﬁg” command

Failure to follow these Security Rules will cause the module to operate in a non-compliant state.

Key to Entity
The cryptographic module associates all keys (secret, private, or public) stored within, entered into or output from the
module with authenticated operators of the module. Keys stored within the module are only made available to
authenticated operators via TLS or SSH. Keys are only input or output from the module by the authenticated operator via a
SSH/TLS/IPsec protected communication. Any attempt to intervene in the key to entity relationship would require defeating
the module TLS/SSH/IPsec encryption and authentication/integrity mechanism.

12. Mitigation of Other Attacks
The module is not designed to mitigate any speciﬁc attacks outside the scope of FIPS 140-3. These requirements are not
applicable.
