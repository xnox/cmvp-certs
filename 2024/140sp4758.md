FIPS 140-3 Non-Proprietary Security Policy

2  Cryptographic Module Specification

Description

The CryptoManager Root of Trust RT-660 cryptographic module (hereafter referred to as
“the module” or "CMRT") is a sub-chip hardware module and its embodiment is of the
type of single chip. The primary application is to provide Root-of-Trust capabilities to
SoCs, where authentication, encrypted content processing using standard protocols, and
protection of keys and other sensitive assets are required. CMRT is suited to a wide range
of products from low power battery powered devices such as mobile phones, tablets, and
wireless handsets, to automotive and AI/ML accelerators.

Table 2 - Cryptographic Module Tested Configuration

CMRT is primarily integrated in the design of Application Specific Integrated Circuits
(ASIC). However, it can also be configured in a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA).
For the purpose of this Cryptographic Module Validation, CMRT is configured and tested
on the Xilinx Zynq XC7Z045 FPGA chip soldered into a Xilinx ZC706 base board, which
belongs to the Zynq-7000 All Programmable SoC (System on a Chip) series.

Modes of Operation

The module does not require any installation, configuration or initialization steps. Once
the module is power on and the self-tests are successful, the module becomes
operational and transitions to approved mode automatically.
The mode of operation is assumed based on the service invoked i.e., the module switches
back and forth between approved and non-approved modes based on the service called.
By default, the module is in approved mode. The non-approved mode of operation is
entered when the module utilizes non-approved security functions in Table 9. The module
switches back to approved mode of operation when the approved service in Table 8 is
called.

Algorithms

Table 3 lists all security functions of the module, including specific keys employed for
approved services, and implemented modes of operation.

Figure 2 – Module Physical boundary, Module Cryptographic boundary, components and interfaces

In the block diagram, the physical boundary of the single chip is outlined with the black
rectangle and the sub-chip cryptographic sub-system boundary, is outlined with the red
rectangle. The white boxes represent the CMRT components that comprise the IP cores
(the CMRT firmware is stored in Program ROM and Program RAM). The yellow boxes
represent components that are provided in the IP core but must be replaced or adjusted
during the configuration process as they are technology dependent (OTP, SRAM, TRNG
FROs).
Also, the block diagram Figure 2 shows the details of all interfaces and the first hierarchy
levels of the CMRT RTL. The greyed-out module components and interfaces are for testing
purpose only (like jtag_ pins) and are disabled for the end user of the module.

Algorithm Specific Information

Hash core:
The Hash Core 1 (2) are components integrated in the modules' cryptographic boundary
as shown in the block diagram with blocks "Hash Engine 1" and “Hash Engine 2"
respectively. Hash Core (HC1) supports SHA2-224, SHA2-256, SHA2-384, SHA2-512,

SHA3-224, SHA3-256, SHA3-384, SHA3-512 and corresponding HMAC. Hash Core (HC2)
supports SHA2-224, SHA2-256, SHA2-384, SHA2-512, SHA2-512/224, SHA2-512/256 and
corresponding HMAC. The KATs are run by the RAM firmware self-tests on both cores. The
HC1 is selected by default and the user can select HC2 based on service input parameter.
The algorithms implemented in each HC and higher-level algorithms with the approved
hash have their own ACVP certificates (See Table 3) per IG C.B.

AES-GCM:
CMRT is compliant with scenario 2 of FIPS 140-3 IG C.H in [FIPS140-3_IG]. The internal IV
is generated in the encryption operation using the RBG-based construction method as
defined in section 8.2.2 of [SP800-38D]. The IV length is 96 bits; and the IV is generated
from the random data obtained from the CTR_DRBG implemented in the module.

3  Cryptographic Module Interfaces

The module embeds a single slave interface and a single master interface. The slave
interface is used to receive commands from one or more host CPU and send the
appropriate response. The master interface is used for autonomous data reads and writes
from and to an external memory, flash or interface.
Additionally, CMRT includes physical ports for showing the crypto module status via
status output interface, and resetting the crypto module via control input interface.
Table 5 describes all the cryptographic module’s interfaces. There is a mapping between
the physical ports and the corresponding logical interfaces with the data that pass over
them.

4.2  Authentication Methods

Except for Hard Reset, the Login service must be executed before any other CMRT
services can be requested. After logging in, an operator (Crypto Officer or U0 to U1 User)
may assume a different role only after logging out followed by logging back in as the
different role. The process to login is divided into two main stages: the initialization stage
is included in the below bullets 1,2,3; the finalization stage is included in the below
bullets 4,5. Precisely, during login the following happens:

1.  An entity accessing the module requests a role identifier (CO or U0 to U1 User) and
provides the ECDSA P-256 public key (the role authentication key) and 128-bit
nonce.

2.  The module calculates SHA2-256 hash of the public key and compares it to the
value found in the OTP root table for the requested role. If the role hasn’t been

4 Internally generated EC Diffie-Hellman private key is used for approved ECDH services and imported EC
Diffie-Hellman private key is used for non-approved ECDH services.

created, or the hash of the public key doesn’t match the value expected, an error
is returned.

3.  If the hash of the public key matches the values found in the OTP root table, the

module returns the session identifier and its own 128-bit nonce.

4.  The entity accessing the module then returns the signature using SHA2-256 on the
concatenation of the role identifier, both nonces, and the role authentication key.
The purpose of this signature is to prove that the entity is in possession of the
private key associated with the public key.

5.  The module verifies the provided signature using the provided public key. Upon
successful signature verification, the authentication succeeds. If the signature
verification fails, an error is returned.

At power-on of the module, the CO is the only available role and only the CO can create
up to two new users.
Authentication status for the U0 to U1 User or CO role is not maintained over the power
cycle (new login is required).

Authentication Strength

ECDSA P-256 is used for authentication (digital signature sign and verify)
with 128 bits of security strength. The chance of a random authentication
attempt falsely succeeding is 1 /2^128 which is less than the claimed
strength objective of 1/1,000,000.
Let’s consider a failed authentication rate of 1 per 1μs and 60,000,000
consecutive attempts per minute. The probability of successful
authentication is then less than or equal to 60,000,000 * 1 /
2^128(≤1.76324e-31) which is much less than the claimed false
acceptance rate of 1 / 100,000 or 10e-5 within one minute.

From above table, the module manages two different types of assets: static and dynamic.
Static assets are stored in the non-volatile memory file in the OTP filesystems and
dynamic asset are stored in the memory file of the SRAM filesystems. Assets are stored in
plaintext within the module and protected from unauthorized disclosure and modification.

9.1  Random Bit Generators

CMRT includes a Deterministic Random Bit Generator based on the CTR_DRBG (with and
without prediction resistance; with derivation function) algorithm and AES-256 as the
underlying cipher according to [SP800-90ARev1]. CMRT uses this engine to:

•  Generate symmetric keys in OTP and SRAM memories with the Generate

Symmetric Key service.

•  Generate asymmetric keys in OTP and SRAM memories with the Generate EC Key

Pair or Generate RSA Key Pair services.

•  Provide random data with the Get TRNG service.

CMRT includes a [SP800-90B] compliant True Random Number Generator (TRNG) to
provide entropy input to the CTR_DRBG. This TRNG automatically seeds the CTR_DRBG,
as part of the TRNG Management Core (TMC) driver initialization process. This process
includes the gathering of enough entropy. After the initialization process, the Crypto
Officer and U0 to U1 (User) can use the Get TRNG service to obtain random numbers from
the TMC.
The CTR_DRBG provides 256 bits of security strength.
The module also performs CTR_DRBG health tests according to section 11.3 of [SP800-
90ARev1].
Table 12 describes the Entropy Source available in CMRT, called ENT (P).

Table 12 - Non-Deterministic Random Number Generation Specification

9.2  SSP Generation

The symmetric and asymmetric key generation methods (vendor affirmed) implemented
in the module are compliant with [SP800-133Rev2] section 4 example 1.

•  CMRT implements symmetric key generation for AES and HMAC keys using random
data (Random in Generation column Table 11) obtained from the SP800-90ARev1
compliant CTR_DRBG. The method in in accordance with SP800-133r2 section 6.1
i.e. the Direct Generation of Symmetric Keys.

•  RSA and Elliptic Curve DSA (ECDSA) asymmetric key pairs are generated in

accordance with [SP800-133Rev2] section 5.1 i.e. which maps to FIPS 186-4. A
seed (i.e. the random value) used in asymmetric key generation is obtained from
the [SP800-90ARev1] CTR_DRBG.

•  Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman key pairs are generated in accordance with [SP800-
133Rev2] section 5.2 i.e. key generation method specified in [SP800-56ARev3]
section 5.6.1.2. used by approved key-establishment schemes which maps to FIPS
186-4.

CMRT implements key derivation methods (KDF in Generation column Table 11, in
compliance with [SP800-108Rev1] and [SP800-56CRev2] one step and two step KDF)
based on a HMAC-SHA-256 counter mode PRF that uses a shared secret and key-
derivation key to generate symmetric and HMAC keys. The symmetric generated key is
compliant with [SP800-133Rev2] section 6.2.2. The [SP800-56CRev2] one step and two
step KDF use a shared secret computed with ECDSA and EC Diffie-Hellman key pair
internally generated by the module.
Intermediate key generation values are not output from the cryptographic module during
or after processing the service.

9.3  SSP Entry and Output

There is no manual key import or export method used in the module.
Symmetric key, HMAC key, asymmetric key pair and secret assets are imported (Import
Key service) and exported (Export Key service) encrypted with the AES-KWP [SP 800-
38F]. The AES key-wrapping-key used by the AES-KWP algorithm cannot be exported by
any methods.
In addition, the module offers KTC port to output symmetric key, and HMAC key using the
service Key Output. The keys are output in plaintext from the module through the KTC
interface.

9.4  SSP Storage

Assets are stored upon creation with data structures related to asset storage location
(SRAM filesystem or OTP filesystem), asset name, asset type and usage policy, asset
ownership and asset data (key and SSPs). When invoking an asset creation service, the
asset ownership is matching the logged-in role (CO or U0 to U1 User). If there is a

26 of 37

CryptoManager Root of Trust RT-660

FIPS 140-3 Non-Proprietary Security Policy

mismatch between the login role and the service requested, the service is stopped and
an error is returned.
Once an asset is created, the ownership and usage attributes of the asset remain until
the asset is deleted or the asset filesystem is zeroized. The asset usage is exclusively
reserved for the owner of the asset and only the owner of the asset has access it to. The
only exception is when an asset is specifically created with the attribute
"FIPS_OWNER_ALL" in which case both CO and User roles can access it. Note however
that only CO can create such asset.
The crypto officer can move any dynamic asset. A User can only move its own dynamic
assets. The crypto officer can delete any asset. A User can only delete its own assets.

9.5  SSP Establishment

CMRT provides the EC Diffie-Hellman key agreement scheme compliant with [SP800-
56ARev3] and scenario 2 of IG D.F

•  path (1) EC Diffie-Hellman SSC with ephemeral Unified scheme and
•  path (2) EC Diffie-Hellman SSC with ephemeral Unified scheme followed by key
derivation with [SP800-56CRev2] compliant using one-step or two step KDF.

The key agreement scheme provides between 112 to 256 bits of security strength. The
key agreement scheme uses EC Diffie-Hellman key pairs internally generated by the
module. The usage of imported EC Diffie-Hellman / ECDSA key pair is considered a non-
approved service.

CMRT also provides key wrapping. As explained in section 9.3, keys can be entered in
encrypted form through the key wrapping method using AES in KWP mode [SP800-38F]
with keys between 128 to 256 bits, compliant with IG D.G approved Key Transport
Method. SSP establishment methodology (AES key wrapping) provides between 128 and
256 bits of encryption strength.

It is the user’s responsibility to use the establishment method with an appropriate key
size to ensure FIPS compliance. Using an insufficient AES key size for AES Key Wrapping
or an insufficient EC Diffie-Hellman key size for KAS will reduce the security strength of
the wrapped key or the established secret/ derived key respectively.

9.6  SSP Zeroization

A dynamic asset is deleted from the SRAM filesystem using the Delete Dynamic Asset
service executed by the owner of the asset. This service can also be executed by the
crypto officer on any of the assets. The SRAM filesystem and all the dynamic assets that
it contains are zeroized following the execution of the Zeroize service with parameter
“FIPS_ZEROIZE_DYNAMIC”. This service can only be executed by the crypto officer. In
addition, when the module is hard reset or powered off, all the dynamic assets of the
SRAM filesystem are deleted.
A static asset is deleted from the OTP filesystem using the Delete Static Asset service
executed by the owner of the asset. This service can also be executed by the crypto
officer on any of the assets. The OTP filesystem and all the statics assets that it contains
are zeroized following the execution of the Zeroize service with parameter
“FIPS_ZEROIZE_STATIC”. The static memory becomes unusable. The process is not
reversible and is ending the life of the module. The program RAM is still running. This
service can only be executed by the crypto officer.

CryptoManager Root of Trust RT-660

FIPS 140-3 Non-Proprietary Security Policy

The filesystems and all the assets that they contain are zeroized following the execution
of the Zeroize service with parameter “FIPS_ZEROIZE_ALL”. The execution of this service
is the secure sanitization of the module and corresponds to the decommissioned of the
module lifecyle. The module is no more functional after the execution of the service. This
service can only be executed by the crypto officer.
Zeroization of assets is performed by writing zeroes (in the case of dynamic assets) and
ones (in the case of static assets) to the SRAM or OTP location of the asset. Zeroization of
the SRAM filesystem is performed by writing zeroes to each word present in the SRAM
buffer. Zeroization of the OTP filesystem and root table is performed by writing ones to
each word present in the OTP storage area. The operation is performed in a time that is
not sufficient to compromise SSPs. Additionally, the module processes one input message
at a time: when a Zeroization or Delete Asset service is processed no other input
message accessing the asset storage filesystems can be executed.
Finally, temporary SSPs generated for use during other services are zeroized when they
are no longer needed, by overwriting the memory location of the SSPs with zeroes.
The zeroization indicator is provided by the Zeroize service. When the Zeroize service is
called, its return value indicates the output status. If the return value is 0, the zeroization
has completed successfully. Otherwise, the zeroization has not completed successfully.
When temporary SSPs are generated and zeroized during a service of this module, this is
implicitly indicated by the successful completion of this service.

10 Self-Tests

10.1 Pre-Operational Self-Tests

After successful installation of the FPGA in which CMRT is configured, the CMRT
automatically performs the initialization process. During initialization the pre-operational
self-tests are performed without user intervention to ensure that the module is not
corrupted and that the cryptographic algorithms within the module work as expected.
During the execution of the self-tests, services are not available and no data output is
possible.
If the pre-operational self-tests succeed, then the CMRT proceeds with performing
conditional algorithm self tests as specified in section 10.2.1. If the pre-operational self-
tests fail, then CMRT transitions to the Error state and a corresponding error indication is
given.
CMRT permits the initiation of the pre-operational or conditional self-tests on demand for
periodic testing of the module. In order to perform the on demand self-tests that initiates
the firmware integrity tests and KATs, the Crypto Officer shall power-off and power-on or
do a hard reset of the module. The Self-tests service listed Table 8 performs all the KATs
of the firmware application loaded in RAM.

10.1.1 Pre-Operational Firmware Integrity Test

The integrity tests are performed for fboot (first stage bootloader), sboot (second stage
bootloader), RAM firmware image (the application firmware).
At power-on, the following happens:

1.  the ROM integrity is checked automatically by a hardware 32 bit CRC
2.  if the integrity check succeeds, the fboot, located in ROM, is executed and the KAT

SHA2-256 is performed

3.  if the KAT succeeds, the integrity of sboot, located in OTP, is checked by computing
the SHA2-256 hash digest of the sboot firmware and compared to the value stored
in OTP

4.  if the integrity check succeeds, sboot is executed and the SHA2-256 and ECDSA

KATs are performed

5.  if the KATs succeed, the signature of the RAM firmware image (stored in the footer

of the image) is verified using ECDSA P-256 with SHA-256

6.  if this integrity test succeeds, the rest of the CASTs located in the application

firmware is performed

If one of the KATs or integrity checks fail, the CMRT transitions to the Error state and a
corresponding error indication is given.
SP800-90B health tests (APT and RCT) are performed at start-up on 1,024 samples and at
runtime.

10.2 Conditional Self-Tests

If one of the Conditional Tests fail, the CMRT transitions to the Error state and a
corresponding error indication is given.

10.2.1 Conditional Cryptographic Algorithm Self-Tests

After successful completion of the pre-operational self test, the module automatically
performs all cryptographic algorithm self tests listed in the below table without any user
intervention. The CASTs consist in Known Answer Tests for all the approved cryptographic

11 Life-Cycle Assurance

11.1 Delivery and Operation

CMRT configured in the Xilinx Zynq XC7Z045 FPGA is a single chip hardware module. The
chip is delivered from the vendor via a trusted delivery courier. Upon reception of CMRT,
the customer should verify that the package does not have any irregular tears or
openings.
The delivery packages (HW: 950-660931-13 and FW: 951-602931-131) directly map the
module HW and FW versions.

When the CMRT module is delivered as part Xilinx Zynq XC7Z045 FPGA with the above
listed module versions, the signals greyed out in Figure 2 are disabled and cannot be
enabled again. Customers who intend to purchase the soft IP core to be added to their
own SoC should note that these signals can be enabled by updating the RTL code in order
to facilitate module testing before finalizing the production version. Specifically, TRNG
test, Char & Validation I/F when enabled through RTL code, can be used to allow
exercising specific test features for algorithm testing and trigger error for the purposes of
functional testing during FIPS validation.

11.2 Guidance Documents

Rambus provides the following documentation part of the delivered module's package:

•  RT-660 CryptoManager RoT External Ref Spec [Last Revision May27.2021; 007-

660130-222/914]

•  CMRT RT-660 FPGA Hardware Reference Manual [Version: 1.0; Doc Number: 007-

660130-412/931]

•  RT-660 – FIPS 140-3 Embedded Software Architecture Specification [Version 1.02;

Last Revision Novembter15, 2021; Doc Number: 005-660130-320/931]
•  CMRT HLOS Programmer's Guide [007-602131-321/911 Rev B, 2021-08-31]

11.2.1 Administrator Guidance

The module is configured as a FIPS140-3 module at factory for the Xilinx Zynq XC7Z045
FPGA tested implementation. In this FPGA configuration the Crypto Officer should execute
the "Show Status" service to verify:

•
•
•
•

the hardware version output as BUILDER_VERSION = 0x60000931
the firmware version output as Sboot version: 2022-02-24-g801c166
the supervisor version output as 2022-02-24-g801c166
the module approved mode status output as "FIPS Mode: 1"

The hash value of the Crypto Officer’s authentication key is provisioned in the OTP root
