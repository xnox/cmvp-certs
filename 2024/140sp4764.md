Purpose of the Security Policy

There are three major reasons for which a security policy is needed:

It is required for a FIPS 140-3 validation,

•
•  To  provide  a  specification  of  the  cryptographic  security  that  will  allow  individuals  and  organizations  to

determine whether the cryptographic module, as implemented, satisfies the stated security policy.

•  To describe to individuals and organizations the capabilities, protection, and access rights provided by the
cryptographic module, thereby allowing an assessment of whether the module will adequately serve the
individual or organizational security requirements.

Target Audience

This document is a part of the package of documents that is submitted for FIPS 140-3 conformance validation of
the module. It is intended for the following people:

•  Developers.
•  FIPS 140-3 testing laboratory.
•  The Cryptographic Module Validation Program (CMVP).
•  Administrators of the cryptographic module.
•  Users of the cryptographic module.

Table 2. Tested Operational Environments

The CMVP makes no statement as to the correct operation of the module or the security strengths of the generated
keys when ported to an operational environment which is not listed on the validation certificate.

The following platforms have not been tested as part of the FIPS 140-3 Level 1 certification however Samsung
affirms  that  these  platforms  are  compliance  to  the  tested  and  validated  platforms.  Additionally,  Samsung  also
affirms that the Module will function the same way and provide the same security services on any of the operating
systems listed below.

Table 3. Vendor Affirmed Operational Environments

Modes of operation

When the module starts up, the Self-tests are executed automatically and the module enters the operational state
if the self-tests pass. A failure of the self-test invokes a panic and the only way to recover the state is to reboot.

Table 4 lists all Approved security functions of the module, including specific key size(s) employed for approved
services, and implemented modes of operation. The module is in the Approved mode of operation when the module
utilizes  the  services  that  use  the  security  functions  listed  in  the  Table  4.    The  Approved  mode  of  operation  is
configured in the system by default and can only be transitioned into the non-Approved mode by calling one of the
non-Approved services listed in Table 10.

5. Software/Firmware security

Integrity techniques

The  module  is  provided  in  the  form  of  binary  executable  code.  To  ensure  the  software  security,  the  module  is
protected by HMAC-SHA2-256 (HMAC Certs. #A3242) algorithm. The software integrity test key (non-SSP) was
preloaded to the module’s binary in the factory and used for software integrity test only at the pre-operational self-
test. At Module’s initialization, the integrity of the runtime executable is verified using a HMAC-SHA2-256 digest
which is compared to a value computed at build time. If at load time the MAC does not match the stored, known
MAC value, the module would enter to an Error state with all crypto functionality inhibited.

Integrity test on-demand

Integrity test is performed as part of the Pre-Operational Self-Tests. It is automatically executed at power-on. The
operator can power-cycle or reboot the tested platform to initiate the software integrity test on-demand.

6. Operational environment

The module operates in a modifiable operational environment per FIPS 140-3 level 1 specifications. The module
runs within a commercially available kernel of the general-purpose operating system. The module is executing on
the hardware specified in the Table 2.

The operating is restricted to a single operator. Only a single instance of the module is allowed in the Operational
environment.  The  operating  environment  is  non-configurable  for  the  operator.  The  operational  environment
provides the capability to separate the module during operation from other functions in the operational environment.
Those functions do not obtain information from the module related to the CSPs and do not modify CSPs, PSPs, or
the execution flow of the module other than via the interfaces provided by the module itself.

The module does not spawn any processes.

7. Physical security

The module is comprised of software only and thus does not claim any physical security.

8. Non-invasive security

The module does not implement non-invasive attack mitigation techniques to protect the module’s unprotected
SSPs from non-invasive attacks referenced in Annex F of FIPS 140-3.

SSP entry and output

SSPs enter the module's cryptographic boundary as cryptographic algorithm API parameters in plaintext. They are
associated  with  memory  locations  and  do  not  persist  across  power  cycles.  The Approved  and  Non-Approved
services listed in Table 4.  and Table 5 are working with separate data blocks, so sharing SSP at switching between
approved/non-approved is impossible.

SSP storage

The  module  does  not  provide  persistent  storage  for  keys  or  SSPs.  The  module  uses  pointers  to  plaintext
keys/SSPs that are passed in by the calling application. The module does not store any SSP beyond the lifetime
of an API call. Allocated memory in RAM for SSP is managed by the module.

SSP zeroization

The zeroization mechanism for all of the CSPs is to replace 0s in the memory which originally store the CSPs.
Zeroization of the sensitive data within the module and is performed automatically in the frame of release of early
allocated crypto handler, by calling function crypto_free_<transformation type>()  e.g. crypto_free_skcipher() for
symmetric cyphers or crypto_free_shash() for hashes. In addition, powering down the tested platform also has all
SSPs zeroized.

10. Self-tests

All  the  pre-operational  self-test  and  conditional  self-tests  are  performed  automatically  in  the  frame  of  module
initialization routine at the kernel boot up. The module performs Cryptographic Algorithm Self-Tests (CASTs) first,
and then subsequently conducts the software integrity test.

The Self-tests do not require any operator intervention. If any of the Self-tests fail, the module enters the Error
state. In the Error state, all output interfaces are inhibited and no cryptographic operations are allowed.

The module can be recovered from the Error state by module reboot only.

Pre-operational self-test

The  module  performs  Pre-operational  Self-tests  automatically  when  the  module  is  loaded  into  memory  (i.e.  at
power on). The Pre-operational Self-tests contain pre-operational software integrity test to ensure that the module
is not corrupted. The integrity test is performed on the runtime image of the module using HMAC-SHA2-256. Prior
to  software  integrity  test,  a  CAST  for  HMAC-SHA2-256  is  performed.    If  the  CAST  on  the  HMAC-SHA-256  is
successful, the HMAC value of the runtime image is recalculated and compared with the stored HMAC value pre-
computed at compilation time (for details, see also Section 5). While the module is performing the Pre-operational
Self-tests no other functions are available and all output is inhibited. Once Pre-operational Self-tests are completed
successfully, the module enters operational mode and cryptographic services are available.

Conditional self-tests

Cryptographic algorithm self-tests

The module performs Cryptographic Algorithm Self-Tests at module initialization to ensure that the algorithms
work as expected, before any security function or process is invoked via module interface, as detailed below.

Periodic/Self-tests on-demand

Table 12. Cryptographic Algorithm Self-Tests

The module performs on-demand self-tests initiated by the operator (via calling fips140_post() service), by power-
cycling, or rebooting the tested platform.  The pre-operational software integrity test and the full suite of self-tests
listed in Table 12 are executed. The same procedure may be employed by the operator to perform periodic self-
tests. If any of the tests fail, the module will enter error state.

Error state and status indicators

The module has a variable (skc_fips_enabled) indicating the status of the Self-test. It contains 0 if the Self-test was
failed and it contains 1 if the Self-test was successful.

The kernel logs contains message:

   FIPS : POST - integrity test failed

 in case of integrity test is failed,

  FIPS : <alg name>, test failed, err=<test number>

11. Life-cycle assurance

Configuration management

Perforce  is  used  as  the  repository  for  both  source  code  and  documents.  All  source  code  and  documents  are
maintained in an internal server. Release is based on the Changelist number, which is automatically generated.
Every check-in process creates a new Changelist number.

Versions of controlled items include information about each version. For documentation, document version number
inside  the  document  provides  the  current  version  of  the  document.  Version  control  maintains  all  the  previous
versions and the version control system automatically numbers revisions. For source code, unique information is
associated with each version such that source code versions can be associated with binary versions of the final
product.  The  source  code  of  the  module  available  in  the  Samsung  internal  Perforce  repository,  as  listed  in
Functional Design document, is used to build target binary.

Secure initialization and startup

This cryptographic module is built-in along with the Linux Kernel. The module is initialized during the Kernel boot-
up before any cryptographic functionality is available. The Kernel is responsible for the initialization and loading
processes  of  the  module.  The  module  is  designed  with  module  init  entry  point  which  ensures  that  the  Pre-
operational self-tests and CASTs are initiated automatically when the module is loaded.

Delivery and operation

The module is provided directly to solution developers and is not available for direct download to the general public.
The module sources are stored and maintained at a secure development facility with controlled access.

The  development  team  and  the  manufacturing  factory  share  a  secured  internal  server  for  exchanging  binary
software images. The factory is also a secure site with strict access control to the manufacturing facilities. The
module binary is installed on the mobile devices (phone and tablets) using direct binary image installation at the
factory.  The  mobile  devices  are  then  delivered  to  mobile  service  operators.  Users  cannot  install  or  modify  the
module.

Samsung  vets  all  service  providers  and  establishes  secure  communication  with  them  for  delivery  of  tools  and
software updates. If the binary is modified by an unauthorized entity, the device has a feature to detect the change
and thus not accept the binary modified by an unauthorized entity.

12. Mitigation of other attacks

The module does not implement security mechanisms to mitigate other attacks.
