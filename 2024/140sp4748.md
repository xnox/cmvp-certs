FIPS 140-3 Non-Proprietary Security Policy

1  General

1.1  This Security Policy Document
This Security Policy describes the features and design of the module named Qualcomm® Crypto
Engine Core 1 using the terminology contained in the FIPS 140-3 specification. The FIPS 140-3
Security Requirements for Cryptographic Modules specifies the security requirements that will be
satisfied by a cryptographic module utilized within a security system protecting sensitive but
unclassified information. The NIST/CCCS Cryptographic Module Validation Program (CMVP)
validates cryptographic modules to FIPS 140-3. Validated products are accepted by the Federal
agencies of both the USA and Canada for the protection of sensitive or designated information.

1.2  How this Security Policy was Prepared

In preparing the Security Policy document, the laboratory formatted the vendor-supplied
documentation for consolidation without altering the technical statements therein contained. The
further refining of the Security Policy document was conducted iteratively throughout the
conformance testing, wherein the Security Policy was submitted to the vendor, who would then
edit, modify, and add technical contents. The vendor would also supply additional documentation,
which the laboratory formatted into the existing Security Policy, and resubmitted to the vendor for
their final editing.

This document is the non-proprietary FIPS 140-3 Security Policy for versions 5.7.0, 5.7.2 and 5.7.3
of the Qualcomm Crypto Engine Core. It has a one-to-one mapping to the [SP 800-140B] starting
with section B.2.1 named “General” that maps to section 1 in this document and ending with
section B.2.12 named “Mitigation of other attacks” that maps to section 12 in this document.

2.3  Description of Modes of Operations

The Qualcomm Crypto Engine Core supports two modes of operation: approved mode and a non-
approved mode. The switching of modes of operation is implicit depending on the service invoked,
but the approved services are explicitly identified by an indicator. The Qualcomm Crypto Engine
Core enters approved mode after successful completion of the conditional algorithm self-tests.
When the operator invokes a non-approved service, the Qualcomm Crypto Engine Core implicitly
switches to its non-approved mode. If the module is in the non-approved mode of operation and

for control input and status output interfaces. Qualcomm Crypto Engine Core FIFOs are
implemented to provide the high-speed interfaces for data input and data output. The Qualcomm
Crypto Engine Core does not implement a Control Output interface.

If a caller wants to use a non-Approved cipher, a separate “pipe pair” must be used or a new key
for the non-Approved cipher must be loaded.

7  Physical Security

The Qualcomm Crypto Engine Core Cryptographic Module is a single-chip hardware module which
conforms to the Level 2 requirements for physical security. The Qualcomm Crypto Engine Core is a
sub-chip that is enclosed within production grade components.

At the time of manufacturing, the die containing the Qualcomm Crypto Engine Core is embedded
within a printed circuit board (PCB), which prevents visibility into the internal circuity of the
Qualcomm Crypto Engine Core. The layering process which embeds the die into the PCB prevents
tampering of the physical components without leaving tamper evidence.

The Qualcomm Crypto Engine Core is further protected by being enclosed in a commercial off-the-
shelf mobile device which is itself made with production grade commercially available
components. This mobile device enclosure completely surrounds the Qualcomm Crypto Engine
Core.

There are no steps required to ensure that physical security is maintained.

9.2  SSP Generation

The Qualcomm Crypto Engine Core does not perform SSP generation for any algorithms.

9.3  SSP Entry and Output

The module does not provide SSP entry or output services. Instead, SSPs are provided from the
caller within the tested operation environment’s physical perimeter (TOEPP) hardware via a single-
chip TOEPP path, which is not considered SSP establishment by Table 1 of FIPS 140-3 IG 9.5.A.
SSPs can only be written to the Qualcomm Crypto Engine Core by the boot loader by writing to the
key registers or into the FIFOs assigned to the particular use case.

Any attempt to write to a non-assigned FIFO is blocked. The Qualcomm Crypto Engine Core
ensures that there is no means to obtain CSP or key data from the Qualcomm Crypto Engine Core
by placing the CSPs into write-only registers. This action prevents an entity interacting with the
Qualcomm Crypto Engine Core from being able to read the CSPs.

9.4  SSP Storage

The Qualcomm Crypto Engine Core stores all SSPs internally (the storage is non-persistent). In
addition, all SSPs are stored write-only and are not readable outside of the Qualcomm Crypto
Engine Core. Therefore, any attempt to read SSPs are blocked by the Qualcomm Crypto Engine
Core control logic, which will return zeros instead of an SSP.

9.5  SSP Zeroization

When the Qualcomm Crypto Engine Core receives a reset event, it will zeroize all SSPs contained
within the FIPS 140-3 Non-Proprietary Security Policy. The registers for the SSPs are set to zero
during power-off, indicating implicitly that SSP zeroization was successful.

10 Self-tests

Cryptographic algorithm self-tests (CASTs) are automatically performed during power-up of the
Qualcomm Crypto Engine Core. During CAST execution, no services are available, and input and
output are inhibited by the Qualcomm Crypto Engine Core control logic.

10.1 Pre-Operational Tests

The Qualcomm Crypto Engine Core is solely implemented in hardware and does not have any
software or firmware components. As such, the module does not perform any pre-operational
software/firmware integrity test. Instead, the module performs the CASTs listed in Table 11 as the
pre-operational self-test.

The Qualcomm Crypto Engine Core does not implement a pre-operational bypass test nor pre-
operational critical functions test.

10.2 Conditional Self-Tests

The Qualcomm Crypto Engine Core conditional self-tests are CASTs and have been listed in Table
11. These CASTs are executed during each power-on.

The Qualcomm Crypto Engine Core does not implement a Software/Firmware Load Test, Manual
Entry Test, Conditional Bypass Test, or a Conditional Critical Functions Test.

The operator may invoke self-tests on-demand by powering-off and reloading the Qualcomm
Crypto Engine Core. During the execution of the on-demand self-tests, no cryptographic services
are available, and no data output or input is possible.

10.4 Error States

Table 12 below lists the causes that trigger the Qualcomm Crypto Engine Core to enter its error
state. When entering its error state, the Qualcomm Crypto Engine Core sets the BIST_FAILURE
register to indicate that it is in the error state. While in the error state, all data input and output
are prohibited and no further cryptographic operation is allowed. The Qualcomm Crypto Engine

Qualcomm® Crypto Engine Core

FIPS 140-3 Non-Proprietary Security Policy

Core control logic enforces this prohibition by preventing external usage while the module is in the
error state. In addition, neither caller-induced nor internal errors reveal any sensitive material to
callers.

Once the Qualcomm Crypto Engine Core is in the error state, it will only respond to a reset
command. A reset will cause the Qualcomm Crypto Engine Core to re-execute its CASTs. The
Qualcomm Crypto Engine Core will remain unavailable until it passes its CASTs.

11 Life-cycle assurance

11.1 Delivery and Operation

The Qualcomm Crypto Engine Core is a sub-chip module that runs on the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2
Mobile Platform SoC,  Qualcomm QCM4490 SoC, Qualcomm QCS4490 SoC, Snapdragon 4 Gen 2
Mobile Platform SoC, and Snapdragon XR2 Gen 2 Platform SoC. The vendor uses a trusted delivery
courier to transport the SoC to their customers. On the reception of the SoC, the operator shall
first check all sides of the box to verify that it has not been tampered with during the shipment.
Then, after opening the box the operator shall verify that the moisture barrier bag is still sealed
and does not present any trace of tampering. Finally, after retrieving the SoC, the operator shall
perform a visual inspection of the external package of the module; it should look similar to the
picture in Figure 2. If one of these verifications fail, the operator shall contact their Qualcomm
Technologies’ representative who released the delivery before operating the module.

Once the product is received by the customer and powered up, the tests defined in Table 11 will
be executed.

11.2 End of Life

Because the module does not have persistent storage, all SSPs are zeroized and the module is
securely sanitized when powered down. Thus, the module may be distributed to other operators or
disposed of after each power off.

11.3 Crypto Officer Guidance

The operation of the Qualcomm Crypto Engine Core does not need FIPS 140-3 specific guidance.
The FIPS 140-3 functional requirements are always met.

For using the cryptographic services of the Qualcomm Crypto Engine Core, the manual for the
Qualcomm Crypto Engine Core covers the description of the register set as well as the use of the
FIFOs channels should be used.

NOTE:

•  The module ensures that the AES algorithm in XTS mode is only used for the cryptographic
protection of data on storage devices, as specified in [SP800-38E]. The module does not
support AES-XTS data units longer than 220 AES blocks. In compliance with IG C.I, the
module performs a check to ensure that the two AES-XTS keys are different.

11.4 Configuration Management

ClearCase, a version control system from IBM/Rational, is used to manage the revision control of
the hardware code (Verilog code) and hardware documentation. The ClearCase version control
system provides version control, workspace management, parallel development support and build
auditing. The Verilog code is maintained within the ClearCase database used by Qualcomm
Technologies, Inc.
