FIPS 140-3 Non-Proprietary Security Policy

1 General

1.1 This Security Policy Document

This Security Policy describes the features and design of the module named Qualcomm® Trusted
Execution Environment (TEE) Software Cryptographic Library using the terminology contained in
the FIPS 140-3 specification. The FIPS 140-3 Security Requirements for Cryptographic Module
specifies the security requirements that will be satisfied by a cryptographic module utilized within
a security system protecting sensitive but unclassified information. The NIST/CCCS Cryptographic
Module Validation Program (CMVP) validates cryptographic module to FIPS 140-3. Validated
products are accepted by the Federal agencies of both the USA and Canada for the protection of
sensitive or designated information.

The Security Policy document is one document in a FIPS 140-3 Submission Package. In addition to
this document, the Submission Package contains:



The validation report prepared by the lab.

 Other supporting documentation and additional references.

This Non-Proprietary Security Policy may be reproduced and distributed, but only whole and intact
and including this notice. Other documentation is proprietary to their authors.

1.2 How this Security Policy was Prepared

The vendor has provided the non-proprietary Security Policy of the cryptographic module, which
was further consolidated into this document by atsec information security together with other
vendor-supplied documentation. In preparing the Security Policy document, the laboratory
formatted the vendor-supplied documentation for consolidation without altering the technical
statements therein contained. The further refining of the Security Policy document was conducted
iteratively throughout the conformance testing, wherein the Security Policy was submitted to the
vendor, who would then edit, modify, and add technical contents. The vendor would also supply
additional documentation, which the laboratory formatted into the existing Security Policy, and
resubmitted to the vendor for their final editing.

This document is the non-proprietary FIPS 140-3 Security Policy for the Qualcomm® Trusted
Execution Environment (TEE) Software Cryptographic Library. It has a one-to-one mapping to the
[SP800-140B] starting with section B.2.1 named “General” that maps to section 1 in this document
and ending with section B.2.12 named “Mitigation of other attacks” that maps to section 12 in this
document.

3 Triple DES is CAVP certified with CAVP Cert. #A2940. However, there are two requirements from FIPS 140-3 IG C.G below
that contribute to the non-compliance: 1) FIPS 140-3 requires that only 2^16 encryptions are performed with a given key;
2) the aforementioned requirement must be enforced by the module itself, not by policy.

4 GCM is CAVP certified with CAVP Cert. #A2940. However, there are two requirements from FIPS 140-3 IG C.H below that
contribute to the non-compliance: 1) the IV uniqueness must be enforced by the module; 2) FIPS 140-3 requires that only
2^32 cipher operations are performed with a given key.

Table 5 – Non-Approved Algorithms Not Allowed in Approved Services

NOTE: There are no non-approved algorithms allowed in approved mode, and no non-approved
algorithms allowed in the approved mode with no security claimed.

2.5 Description of Modes of Operation

The module implements two modes of operation: (1) the approved mode, in which the approved
services are available; and (2) the non-approved mode, in which the non-approved services are
available. The current mode of operation of the module can be inferred by the service indicator,
which indicates the approved state of the current service being invoked. No configuration is
necessary for the module to operate and remain in the approved or non-approved modes. All SSPs
are kept separate between the two modes.

After the module successfully passes the pre-operational integrity self-test, the module is in the
approved mode. If the operator requests a non-approved service, the module implicitly switches to
the non-approved mode of operation. When in the non-approved mode of operation, if the
operator requests an approved service, the module implicitly switches to the approved mode of
operation.

Table 8 and 9 list the services available in approved and non-approved mode of operation,
respectively.

5 The ECDH has been tested with CAVP certificate #A2940. However, the shared secret generation does not check the key
assurance requirements from SP800-56A Rev 3 around trusted third parties during key import. There is a self-test for ECDH
but is not listed since it is non-approved.

2.6 Cryptographic Module Boundary

The physical perimeter of the Qualcomm® Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) Software
Cryptographic Library is the physical perimeter of the device that contains it. Consequently, the
embodiment of the Qualcomm® Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) Software Cryptographic
Library is a single-chip cryptographic module. Figure 1 shows a block diagram of the module, with
the cryptographic boundary indicated in red, and the physical perimeter in black.

The TOEPP (tested operational environment’s physical perimeter) of the module is the entire single
chip, the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 Mobile Platform.

2.7 Rules of Operation

The Crypto Officer interacts with the Qualcomm® Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) Software
Cryptographic Library in two distinct ways:

1.

Initializing the Qualcomm® Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) Software Cryptographic
Library

2. The application services (API’s) invoked by users

Once Qualcomm® Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) Software Cryptographic Library initializes
and the self-tests complete successfully, all cryptographic functions are made available. See
section 10.3 for error states and error recovery.

Caller-induced or internal errors do not reveal any sensitive material to callers. The Qualcomm®
Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) Software Cryptographic Library ensures that there is no
means to obtain data from itself by performing key zeroization. There is no means to obtain
sensitive information from the Qualcomm® Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) Software
Cryptographic Library.

Table 7 – Roles, Service Commands, Input and Output

4.2 Authentication

The module does not support authentication for roles.

4.3 Services

The module provides services to operators that assume the available role. Services are accessed
through documented API interfaces from the calling application.

Additional services are provided by the bound Pseudo Random Number Generator module on the
Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 Mobile Platform SoC. This Qualcomm® Trusted Execution Environment (TEE)
Software Cryptographic Library utilizes the random number generation service from the bound
Pseudo Random Number Generator module.

The next tables define the services that utilize approved, allowed, and non-approved security
functions in this module. For the respective tables, the convention below applies when specifying
the access permissions (types) that the service has for each SSP.

 Generate (G): The service establishes the SSP by generation, agreement, or derivation.

 Read I: The SSP exists in the module and is read by the service and may be output.

 Write (W): The caller provides the SSP to the service to be imported into the module;

written; or updated if the SSP already exists in the module.

 Execute (E) (or use): The service uses the SSP in performing a cryptographic operation.

Other access types identify the provenance of the SSP.

 Zeroize (Z): The service zeroizes the SSP.

5 Software/Firmware security

5.1 Integrity Techniques

The integrity of the module is verified by comparing a HMAC-SHA-256 value calculated at run time
with the HMAC-SHA-256 value stored in the module that was computed at build time. If the
comparison verification fails, the module transitions to the error state (Section 10.3). The HMAC-
SHA-256 algorithm goes through its cryptographic algorithm self-test before the integrity test is
performed (Table 11).

5.2 On-Demand Integrity Test

The software integrity test is performed as part of the pre-operational self-tests. The pre-
operational self-tests can be invoked when Get_FIPS_Info service is called.

5.3 Executable Code

The module consists of code that will perform algorithmic services for trusted applications. The
code is compiled into a shared library.

7 Physical Security

The Qualcomm® Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) Software Cryptographic Library is a hybrid
software module implemented as part of the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 Mobile Platform SoC, which is
the physical perimeter of the single-chip hybrid software module. The single-chip conforms to the
Level 2 requirements for physical security.

At the time of manufacturing, the die of the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 Mobile Platform SoC is embedded
within a printed circuit board (PCB), which prevents visibility into the internal circuity of the
Qualcomm® Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) Software Cryptographic Library. The layering
process which is used to embed the die into the PCB also prevents tampering of the physical
components without leaving tamper evidence.

The Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 Mobile Platform SoC is further protected by being enclosed in commercial
off the shelf mobile device utilizing production grade, commercially available components and said
mobile device enclosure completely surrounds the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 Mobile Platform SoC.

There are no steps required to ensure that physical security is maintained.

9.1 SSP Establishment/SSP Derivation

The Qualcomm® Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) Software Cryptographic Library implements
Password-Based Key Derivation version 2 (PBKDF2) as defined in [SP800-132]. The PBKDF2
function is provided as a service and returns the key derived from the provided password to the
caller. The supported option is 1a from Section 5.4 of SP 800-132, whereby the Master Key (MK) is
used directly as the Data Protection Key (DPK). The keys derived from passwords, as shown in SP
800-132, may only be used for storage applications.

9.2 SSP Generation

The SSP generation methods implemented in the Qualcomm® Trusted Execution Environment
(TEE) Software Cryptographic Library for approved services are compliant with SP 800-133Rev2.
EC key pair generation is performed according to Appendix B.4.2 of FIPS 186-4 (Testing
Candidates) and corresponds to keys used for ECDSA operations. RSA key pair generation is
performed according to Appendix B.3.3 of FIPS 186-4 (Probable Prime Generation). The seeds (i.e.,
the random values) used in asymmetric key pair generation are directly obtained from the SP 800-
90Arev1 Hash DRBG provided by the bound Qualcomm® Pseudo Random Number Generator
module, compliant with SP 800-133r2 section 4 without the use of V (as specified in additional
comment #2 to IG D.H).





The Qualcomm® Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) Software Cryptographic Library does
not generate symmetric keys.
Intermediate key generation values are not output from the module during or after
processing the service.

9.3 SSP Entry and Output

The Qualcomm® Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) Software Cryptographic Library only
supports manual distribution and electronic entry for SSPs. The SSPs are provided to the module
via API input parameters in plaintext form and output via API output parameters in plaintext form.
The Qualcomm® Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) Software Cryptographic Library does not
enter or output SSPs in plaintext format outside its physical perimeter.

FIPS 140-3 Non-Proprietary Security Policy

9.4 SSP Storage

All SSPs are output from and input to the Qualcomm® Trusted Execution Environment (TEE)
Software Cryptographic Library through the calling process and are destroyed from memory when
released. The Qualcomm® Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) Software Cryptographic Library
does not persistently store SSPs. The SSPs are stored temporarily in plaintext in the RAM.

9.5 SSP Zeroization

The module’s functions deallocate and zeroize temporary SSP values in volatile memory used
during the function’s execution. The zeroization consists of writing zeroes to the memory location
used by the SSP before deallocating the area. The module does not overwrite SSPs with another
SSP.

The zeroization service for the SSPs in volatile memory consists of powering off the module, which
will remove power from the volatile memory. This action will cause the value of the SSPs in volatile
memory to be overwritten by random values the next time the module is powered on. The
successful act of powering off the module serves as the implicit indicator of zeroization.

10.1 Pre-Operational Self-Tests

The Qualcomm® Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) Software Cryptographic Library performs
pre-operational self-tests when loaded into memory, without operator intervention. The pre-
operational self-tests ensure that the Qualcomm® Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) Software
Cryptographic Library is not corrupted. The Qualcomm® Trusted Execution Environment (TEE)
Software Cryptographic Library transitions to the operational state only after the pre-operational
self-tests are passed successfully.

The types of pre-operational self-tests are described in the next sub-sections.

10.1.1Software Integrity Test

Section 5.1 describes the integrity test and the details if the integrity tests are defined in Table 11.

10.2 Conditional Self-Tests

10.2.1Cryptographic Algorithm Self-Tests

The Qualcomm® Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) Software Cryptographic Library performs
self-tests on all approved cryptographic algorithms as part of the approved services using the
tests shown in Table 11. Data output through the data output interface is inhibited during the self-
tests. The Qualcomm® Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) Software Cryptographic Library
transitions to the operational state only after the cryptographic algorithm self-tests are passed
successfully. The known answer test for DRBG is performed by the bound module.

10.2.2Pair-wise Consistency Tests

Pair-wise consistency tests are run whenever the Qualcomm® Trusted Execution Environment
(TEE) Software Cryptographic Library generates an asymmetric (RSA or ECDSA) key pair using a
SHA-256 hash.

10.2.3Periodic/On-Demand Self-Tests

The Qualcomm® Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) Software Cryptographic Library performs
on-demand self-tests initiated by calling the Get_FIPS_Info service. All self-tests in Table 11
marked as “Power up” are then executed. An operator can perform the pair-wise consistency tests
on demand by requesting the Key Pair Generation service for RSA or ECDSA.

10.3 Error States

If the Qualcomm® Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) Software Cryptographic Library fails any
of the self-tests, the Qualcomm® Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) Software Cryptographic
Library enters the error state. In the error state, the data output interface is inhibited, and the
module accepts no more inputs or requests. To recover from the error state, re-initialization is
possible by successful execution of the pre-operational self-tests and cryptographic algorithm self-
tests, which can be triggered by a power-off/power-on cycle.

Table 12 lists the error state and the status indicator (through calling the qsee_get_fips_info()
function with the info_type parameter set to QSEE_FIPS_SELFTEST_STATUS) values that explains
the error that has occurred.

11.1 Configuration Management

Perforce Visual Client (P4V), a version control system from Perforce, is used to manage the
revision control of the Qualcomm® Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) Software Cryptographic
Library software code. The Perforce Visual Client provides version control, branching and merging
of code lines, and concurrent development.

Git, an open-source version control system, is also used to manage the revision control of the
Qualcomm® Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) Software Cryptographic Library unified crypto
software code. Git provides version control, branching and merging of code lines, and concurrent
development.

11.2 Delivery and Operation

The Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 Mobile Platform SoC is delivered from the vendor via a trusted delivery
courier.

On the reception of the SoC, the operator shall first check all sides of the box to verify that it has
not been tampered during the shipment. Then, after opening the box the operator shall verify that
the moisture barrier bag is still sealed and does not present any trace of tampering. Finally, after
retrieving the SoC, the operator shall perform a visual inspection of the external SoC package of
the module, it should appear similar to the pictures in Section 2.6.

If one of these verifications fail, the operator shall contact their Qualcomm representative which
released the delivery before operating the module.

Once the product is received by the customer, configured as defined in section 11.5, and powered
up, the test defined in section 10 will be executed.

11.3 Maintenance Requirements

There are no maintenance requirements.

11.4 End of Life

As stated in Section 9.4, the module does not possess persistent storage of SSPs. The SSP values
only exist in volatile memory and these values vanish when the module is powered off. The
procedure for secure sanitization of the module at the end of life is simply to power it off, which is
the action of zeroization of the SSPs (as specified in Section 9.5). As a result of this sanitization via
power-off, all SSPs are removed from the module, so that the module may either be distributed to
other operators or disposed.

11.5 Crypto Officer Guidance

To enable FIPS for the Qualcomm® Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) Software Cryptographic
Library, the fuse must be set according to Table 2. The fuse enablement is mandatory to run as a
FIPS validated module. This step needs to be performed only once during initial configuration.

The information required for the Crypto Officer to verify the Qualcomm® Trusted Execution

parameter set to QSEE_FIPS_MODULE_HMAC (0). The buffer parameter should point to a
buffer which is at least 32 bytes long, and the buffer_len parameter should be at least
32.

o The result buffer should contain the HMAC-SHA-256 of the Qualcomm® Trusted

Execution Environment (TEE) Software Cryptographic Library.

o To get the HMAC of the 64-bit Qualcomm® Trusted Execution Environment (TEE)

Software Cryptographic Library, this should be run from a 64-bit Trusted Application.



The FIPS enablement fuse is blown.

o This can be done by invoking the qsee_get_fips_info() function with the info_type

parameter set to QSEE_FIPS_FUSE_STATUS (1). The buffer parameter should point to a
4-byte buffer (sizeof(uint32)) and the buffer_len parameter should equal 4.

o The result buffer should contain the value QSEE_FIPS_FUSE_BLOWN (1).



The pre-operational self-tests have passed.

o This can be done by calling qsee_get_fips_info() with the info_type parameter set to

QSEE_FIPS_SELFTEST_STATUS (2). The buffer parameter should point to a 4-byte buffer
(sizeof(uint32)) and the buffer_len parameter should equal 4.

o The result buffer contains an integer with below representation. Users should

interpret the value correspondingly. When a self test for an algorithm is not run, the
passed bit and the failed bit will be both 0. After a self test is run, it will be either
passed or failed.

Qualcomm® Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) Software Cryptographic Library

FIPS 140-3 Non-Proprietary Security Policy

Cryptographic Library does not need FIPS 140-3 specific guidance. The FIPS 140-3 functional
requirements are always invoked.

To use the cryptographic services of the Qualcomm® Trusted Execution Environment (TEE)
Software Cryptographic Library, please refer to 80-NH537-4: Qualcomm Trusted Execution
Environment Version 5.0 User Guide.

NOTES:







In compliance with [SP 800-38E], the AES algorithm in XTS mode shall only be used for the
cryptographic protection of data on storage devices, and the length of a single data unit
encrypted with the AES-XTS shall not exceed 2^20 AES blocks. In compliance with IG C.I,
the module performs a check to ensure that the two AES-XTS keys are different.

The module supports option 1a from section 5.4 of [SP800-132] PBKDF, in which the Master
Key (MK) or a segment of it is used directly as the Data Protection Key (DPK). In compliance
with [SP800-132] and IG D.N, the following requirements are met.

o Keys derived from passwords shall only be used in storage applications. The Master
Key (MK) shall not be used for other purposes. The length of the MK or DPK shall be
128 bits or more.

o A portion of the salt, with a length of at least 128 bits, shall be generated randomly

using the SP800-90Arev1 DRBG.

o The iteration count shall be selected as large as possible, as long as the time

required to generate the key using the entered password is acceptable for the
users. The minimum value is 1000.

o Passwords or passphrases, used as an input for the PBKDF2, shall not be used as

cryptographic keys.

o The length of the password or passphrase is at least 8 characters. For all numeric
values, the probability of guessing the value is estimated to be 10^{-8}, which is
greater than 2^{-112}.

In compliance with IG C.F, the module supports 2048, 3072, 4096-bit RSA modulus lengths
for RSA signature generation. All the RSA signature algorithm implementations have been
tested for all implemented RSA modulus lengths. The minimum number of Miller-Rabin
tests used in primality testing for key generation is consistent with Table B.1 of FIPS 186-4.
The module supports RSA signature verification with 1024, 2048, 3072, 4096-bit modulus
lengths, all of which have been CAVP tested.

FIPS 140-3 Non-Proprietary Security Policy

12 Mitigation of other attacks

The elliptic curve implementation uses the Montgomery Ladder, as well as blinding of base points
and private key multiplication. The RSA implementation uses base and modulus blinding to
mitigate timing-based side-channel attacks. Blinding countermeasures add randomness to private
key operations, making determination of secrets from observations more difficult for the attacker.
