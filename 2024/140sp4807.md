WildFire 10.1 WF-500 Security Policy  2

1.  General

The Wildfire 10.1 WF-500 from Palo Alto Networks Inc., hereafter referred to as “WildFire” or the “cryptographic module”
is a multi-chip standalone hardware cryptographic module designed to fulfill FIPS 140-3 level 2 requirements. The WildFire
10.1  WF-500 module identifies unknown malware, zero-day exploits, and Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) through
dynamic analysis, and automatically disseminates protection in near real-time to help security teams meet the challenge of
advanced cyber-attacks.

Unknown files are analyzed by WildFire (WF) in a scalable sandbox environment where new threats are identified, and
protections are automatically developed and delivered in the form of an update. The result is a unique, closed loop
approach to controlling cyber threats that begins with positive security controls to reduce the attack surface, inspection of
all traffic, ports, and protocols to block all known threats, and rapid detection of unknown threats by observing their actual
behavior.

The cryptographic module meets the overall requirements applicable to Level 2 security of FIPS 140-3.

2.  Cryptographic Module Specification

The Palo Alto Networks, Inc. WF-500 is a multi-chip standalone module. The module is shown in Figure 1. The
module boundary is the outer chassis enclosure. The cryptographic boundary includes all the logical components of
the modules and the physical perimeter is the outer perimeter of the enclosure of the WF-500. Figure 2 through
Figure 5 provide images of the module with the FIPS kit’s opacity shields in place. See the Physical Security section
for details regarding the module’s physical security mechanisms.

See ‘Cryptographic Module
Interfaces’ Section

Approved Mode of Operation
The module supports only one mode, which is the Approved mode of operation (FIPS-CC mode).  The following section
details the procedure necessary to place the module into the Approved mode of operation.

The following procedure will initialize the module into the Approved mode of operation:

Install module and interface connections in addition to the physical kit.

●
●  The tamper-evident seals and opacity shields must be installed as per Appendix A for the module to operate in

the Approved mode of operation.

●  Apply power to the device.
●  Establish a serial connection to the console port and command the module to enter into maintenance mode.

o  During initial boot up, break the boot sequence via the console port connection (by pressing the maint

button when instructed to do so) to access the main menu.

●  Select “Continue.”
●  Select the “Set FIPS-CC” option, and press enter.
●  Select “Enable FIPS-CC Mode,” and press enter.
●  When prompted, select “Reboot” and the module will re-initialize and continue into the Approved mode.
●  The module will reboot.
●
●  Once the module has finished booting, the Crypto Officer can authenticate using the default credentials that

In the Approved mode, the console port is available only as a status output port.

come with the module

o  Once authenticated, the module will automatically require the operator to change their password; and

the default credential is overwritten

The module will automatically indicate the Approved mode of operation in the following manner:

●  Status output interface will indicate “**** FIPS-CC MODE ENABLED ****” via the CLI session.
●  Status output interface will indicate “FIPS-CC mode enabled successfully” via the console port.

Should one or more power-up self-tests fail, the module will not enter the Approved mode of operation.  Feedback will
consist of:

●  The module will output “FIPS-CC failure.”
●  The module will reboot and enter a state in which the reason for the reboot can be determined by following

the on-screen instructions.

WildFire 10.1 WF-500 Security Policy  4

Note: Disabling “FIPS-CC” mode causes a complete factory reset, which is described in the Zeroization section below.

The module does not support a degraded mode of operation.

Non-Compliant State

Failure to follow the directions in the Approved Mode of Operation above or rules noted in Section 11 will result in the
module operating in a non-compliant state, which is considered out of scope of this validation.

Zeroization

To initiate the zeroization service, perform the following steps:

●  Access the module’s CLI via SSH, and command the module to enter maintenance mode; the module will

reboot

o  Note: Establish a serial connection to the console port

●  After reboot, select “Continue.”
●  Select “Factory Reset.”
●  The module will perform a zeroization, and provide the following message once complete:

o

“Factory Reset Status: Success”

*The module is compliant to IG C.H: GCM is used in the context of TLS, IPsec/IKEv2, and SSH:

●  For TLS, The GCM implementation meets Scenario 1 of IG C.H: it is used in a manner compliant with SP
800-52 and in accordance with Section 4 of RFC 5288 for TLS key establishment, and ensures when
the nonce_explicit part of the IV exhausts all possible values for a given session key, that a new TLS
handshake is initiated per sections 7.4.1.1 and 7.4.1.2 of RFC 5246. During operational testing, the
module was tested against an independent version of TLS and found to behave correctly.

o  From this RFC 5288, the GCM cipher suites in use are
TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256,
TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384,
TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256, and
TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384.)

●  For IPsec/IKEv2, The GCM implementation meets Scenario 1 of IG C.H: it is used in a manner compliant
with RFCs 4106 and 7296 (RFC 5282 is not applicable, as the module does not use GCM within IKEv2
itself), and ensures when the module exhausts all possible values for a given session key that this
triggers a rekey condition. During operational testing, the module was tested against an independent
version of IPsec with IKEv2 and found to behave correctly.

●  For SSH, the module meets Scenario 1 of IG C.H. The module conforms to RFCs 4252, 4253, and 5647.

The fixed field is 4-byte in length and is derived using the SSH KDF; this ensures the fixed field is
unique for any given GCM session. The invocation field is 8-byte in length and is incremented for each
invocation of GCM; this prevents the IV from repeating until the entire invocation field space of 264 is
exhausted, which can take hundreds of years. (In FIPS-CC Mode, SSH rekey is automatically configured
at 1 GB of data or 1 hour, whichever comes first.)

In all the above cases, the nonce_explicit is always generated deterministically. AES GCM keys are zeroized when
the module is power-cycled. For each new TLS or SSH session, a new AES GCM key is established.

The module is compliant to IG C.F:

The module utilizes approved modulus sizes 2048, 3072, and 4096 bits for RSA signatures. This functionality has
been CAVP tested as noted above. The minimum number of Miller Rabin tests for each modulus size is
implemented according to Table C.2 of FIPS 186-4. For modulus size 4096 the module implements the largest
number of Miller-Rabin tests shown in Table C.2. RSA SigVer is CAVP tested for all three supported modulus sizes
as noted above. The module does not perform FIPS 186-2 SigVer. All supported modulus sizes are CAVP testable
and tested as noted above. The module does not implement RSA key transport in the approved mode.

The cryptographic module does not support Non-Approved Algorithms Allowed in the Approved Mode of
Operation.

3072, RSA 4096, ECDSA P-256, P-384, or P-
521.

The minimum equivalent strength supported is
112 bits.  The probability that a random
attempt will succeed is 1/(2112) which is less
than 1/1,000,000.  The probability of
successfully authenticating to the module
within a one minute period is 3,600,000/(2112),
which is less than 1/100,000.  The module
supports at most 60,000 new sessions per
second to authenticate in a one-minute period.

Certificate/Public key-based
The security modules support public-key based
authentication using RSA 2048 and certificate-
based authentication using RSA 2048, RSA

2 In FIPS-CC Mode, the module checks and enforces the minimum password length of eight (8) as specified in SP 800-63B.
Passwords are securely stored hashed with salt value, with very restricted access control, and rate limiting mechanism for
authentication attempts.

CSP Access Rights
The following table defines the access to CSPs and the different module services.  While in the Approved mode, all
authenticated services and CSPs are accessed via authenticated TLS or SSH sessions.  Approved and allowed algorithms,
relevant CSPs, and public keys related to these protocols are used to access the services as listed in Table 15.  The modes
of access shown in the table are defined as:

G = Generate: The module generates or derives the SSP.

R = Read: The SSP is read from the module (e.g. the SSP is output).

W = Write: The SSP is updated, imported, or written to the module.

E = Execute: The module uses the SSP in performing a cryptographic operation.

Z = Zeroise: The module zeroises the SSP.

5.
The module performs the Firmware Integrity test by using HMAC-SHA-256 and ECDSA signature verification (HMAC and
ECDSA Cert. #A2137) during the Pre-Operational Self-Test.  In addition, the module also conducts the firmware load test
by using the Public Verification Key (RSA 2048 with SHA-256, Cert. #A2137) for the new validated firmware to be
uploaded into the module via the System Operational Management service. The Firmware Integrity Verification key and
Public key for Firmware Content Load Test used for the Firmware Integrity and Firmware Load test, respectively, are
generated externally and delivered as part of the module firmware image.

The pre-operational self-tests can be initiated by power cycling the module.  When this is performed, the module
automatically runs the cryptographic algorithm self-tests in addition to the pre-operational firmware integrity test.

The module’s executable code is in the form of the compiled firmware image loaded onto the module.

6.  Operational Environment
The FIPS 140-3 Operational Environment requirements are not applicable. The operational environment is limited since the
Module includes a firmware load service to support necessary updates. New firmware versions within the scope of this
validation must be validated through the FIPS 140-3 CMVP. Any other firmware loaded into this module is out of the
scope of this validation and requires a separate FIPS 140-3 validation.

7.  Physical Security
Physical Security Mechanisms
The multi-chip standalone module is production quality and contains standard passivation. Chip components are protected
by an opaque enclosure. There are tamper-evident seals that are applied on the module by the Crypto-Officer, and any
unused seals are to be controlled by the Crypto-Officer. The Crypto-Officer must ensure that the module surface is clean
and dry before applying the seals. The seals prevent removal of the opaque enclosure without evidence, which should be
inspected by the Crypto-Officer every 30 days for evidence of tampering. If the seals or opacity shields show evidence of
tamper, the Crypto-Officer should assume that the module has been compromised and contact Customer Support.

Note:  For ordering information, see Table 1 for physical kit part numbers and version. Opacity shields are included in the
physical kits.

Refer to Appendix A for instructions regarding installation of the tamper seals and opacity shields. Tamper-evident seals
must be pressed firmly onto the adhering surfaces during installation, and once applied, the Crypto-Officer shall permit 24
hours of cure time for all tamper-evident seals. The placement of the twelve (12) tamper-evident seals are shown in
Appendix A.

Operator Required Actions
The following table provides information regarding the various physical security mechanisms, and their recommended
frequency of inspection/test.

© 2025 Palo Alto Networks, Inc.

WildFire 10.1 WF-500 Security Policy  29

4.  Critical Functions Tests

a.  SP 800-56A Rev. 3 Assurance Tests (Based on Sections 5.5.2, 5.6.2, and 5.6.3)

If any self-tests or conditional tests fail, the module will output ‘FIPS-CC failure’ and the specific test that failed.

1.  Power-up self-tests shall not require any operator action.
2.  The operator shall be capable of commanding the module to perform the power-up self-test by power

cycling the module.

3.  Data output shall be inhibited during power-up self-tests and error states.
4.  Processes performing key generation and zeroization processes shall be logically isolated from the logical

data output paths.

5.  The module does not output intermediate key generation values.
6.  Status information output from the module shall not contain CSPs or sensitive data that if misused could

lead to a compromise of the module.

7.  There are no restrictions on which keys or CSPs are zeroized by the zeroization service.
8.  The module maintains separation between concurrent operators.
9.  The module does not support a maintenance interface or role.
10.  The module does not have any external input/output devices used for entry/output of data.
11.  The module does not allow the input or output of plaintext CSPs.
12.  The module provides a warning, “Your device is still configured with the default admin account credentials.

Please change your password prior to deployment.” to inform the operator to change their default
authentication data.

11.  Life-cycle Assurance
The vendor provided life-cycle assurance documentation that describes configuration management, design, finite state
model, development, testing, delivery + operation, end of life procedures, and guidance.  For details regarding the secure
installation, initialization, startup, and operation of the module, see section “Approved Mode of Operation” in Section 2.

Palo Alto Network provides an Administrator Guide for additional information noted in the “References” section of this
Security Policy

Vendor imposed security rules
In FIPS-CC mode, the following rules shall apply:

1.

If the cryptographic module remains inactive in any valid role for the administrator specified time interval,
the module automatically logs out the operator.

2.
3.  The module enforces a timed access protection mechanism that supports at most ten authentication

attempts per minute.  After the administrator-specified number of consecutive unsuccessful password
validation attempts have occurred, the cryptographic module shall enforce a wait period of at least one (1)
minute before any more login attempts can be attempted.
In FIPS-CC mode, the following rules shall apply:

4.

A.  The operator should not enable TLSv1.0 or use RSA for key wrapping; it is disabled by default.

■ Checked via CLI using “show shared” command

B.

If using RADIUS, it must be configured using TLS.

© 2025 Palo Alto Networks, Inc.

WildFire 10.1 WF-500 Security Policy  30

■ Checked via CLI using “show shared” command

Failure to follow these Security Rules will cause the module to operate in a non-compliant state.

12.  Mitigation of Other Attacks
The module is not designed to mitigate any specific attacks outside the scope of FIPS 140-3.  These requirements are not
applicable.

Appendix A – WF-500 Physical Kit Installation Guide (12 Tamper-Evident
Seals)
This section provides steps on how to install the Physical Kit on the WF-500 module.

© 2025 Palo Alto Networks, Inc.

WildFire 10.1 WF-500 Security Policy  32

Step 1:
Remove the two pull handles and front modules on the left and right side of the appliance by removing the three (3)
screws located behind each handle/module.  There is no need to disconnect the LED circuit board attached to the
end of the ribbon cable.  Retain these screws for Step 2.

Figure 8 – Remove Front Handles and Modules

Step 2:
Attach the left and right front cover brackets to the appliance using the six (6) screws that were removed in Step 1.
First attach the brackets using the bottom screws (one (1) on each side) as shown in Figure 9, ensuring that you feed
the ribbon cable and LED circuit board through the left bracket.  Replace the front modules and secure them using
the middle and top screws on each side as shown in Figure 10.

Figure 9 – Secure the Front Brackets

© 2025 Palo Alto Networks, Inc.

WildFire 10.1 WF-500 Security Policy  33

Figure 10 - Attach Pull Handles and Front Modules

Step 3:
Secure the front opacity shield to the right and left front brackets that you installed in Step 2.  Use two (2) screws
(provided) on each side.

Figure 11 – Install Front Opacity Shield

© 2025 Palo Alto Networks, Inc.

WildFire 10.1 WF-500 Security Policy  34

Figure 12 – Front Opacity Shield Installed

Step 4:
Attach the rear opacity shield tray to the appliance.  First, remove the two (2) screws (shown in Figure 13) from the
appliance and use these screws to secure the rear opacity shield tray.
Note: Install the back cables (power cords and network/management cables) because you will not be able to access
these ports after the next step.

Figure 13 – Install Rear Opacity Shield Tray

Step 5:
Place the rear opacity shield on top of the rear opacity shield tray ensuring that you run the cables through the
opening at the bottom.  Secure the opacity shields with two (2) screws (provided) on each side.

WildFire 10.1 WF-500 Security Policy  35

Figure 14 – Install Rear Opacity Shield

Step 6:
Cover the vent openings as shown in Figure 15 by applying one (1) overlay tamper-evident seal over the left side
vent and one overlay tamper-evident seal over the right side vent.  Each overlay requires two (2) tamper-evident
seals as shown in Figure 16.  Also apply one (1) additional tamper-evident seal as shown in Figure 16, #5.

WildFire 10.1 WF-500 Security Policy  36

Figure 16 – Apply Tamper-Evident Seals on Vent Overlays and Side Opening

Step 7:
Attach the rail kit to the appliance as shown in Figure 17 and then add three (3) tamper-evident seals to the bottom
of the appliance as shown in Figure 18.  One (1) tamper-evident seal prevents tampering of the front opacity shield
connected to the bottom of the appliance and two (2) tamper-evident seals wrap around the upper and lower rear
opacity shields to prevent tampering of the rear opacity shields.

WildFire 10.1 WF-500 Security Policy  37

Figure 18 – Apply Tamper-Evident Seals on the Bottom of the Appliance

Step 8:
Place four (4) tamper seals on the top of the appliance. Two (2) tamper seals (#9 and #11) prevent tampering of the
top front and rear opacity shields and two (2) tamper seals (#10 and #12) prevents someone from attempting to
access the vent overlays by sliding the rail kit. This completes the physical kit installation.
