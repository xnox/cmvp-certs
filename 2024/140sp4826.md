Section 2 – Cryptographic Module Specification
KIOXIA FIPS TC58NC1137GTC/TC58NC1138GTC Crypto Sub-Chip (listed in Section2.1 Product
Version) is used for solid state drive (SSD) data security. The CM is a single chip hardware
module implemented as a sub-chip compliant with IG 2.3.B in the TC58NC1137GTC 0001 SoC
and TC58NC1138GTC 0001 SoC (see Figure 1 in Section 7). Overall Security Rating of the CM is
Level2 (See Table 1 in Section 1 for individual security area levels). The CM is embedded in TCG
OPAL compliant SSD controllers which provides user data encryption/decryption through
build-in HW engines.
The CM provides various cryptographic services using approved algorithms. The CM has
multiple functions, but they do not support the degraded operation. The physical boundary of
the CM is the TC58NC1137GTC 0001 SoC and TC58NC1138GTC 0001 SoC, and the logical
boundary of the CM is TC58NC1137GTC/TC58NC1138GTC CRPT module.
The CM has one approved mode of operation and CM is always in approved mode of operation
after initial operations are performed (See Section 11). In approved mode, the CM provides
services defined in Table 7 in Section 4.2.

Table 5 ‐ Roles, Service Commands, Input and output

The CM supports the configuration of roles and services. The authenticated operator is expected
to configure locked bands for data storage, the associated role and the lock-based
authentication data (PIN) per Table 5 (refer to section 11 for detail settings to maintain secure
operation). Bands that are not configured are considered unprotected or plaintext. This
configuration enables Data Read/Write service using the lock-based authentication model (IG
4.1.A). To Read/Write data from/to each band, an operator must unlock the bands with
appropriate authenticated roles. Once the bands are unlocked, Read and Write access to the
bands must be controlled by a trusted operator outside of the module who has authenticated
the associated role until powered off. The module prevents Data read/write service for locked
bands. If Read and Write access needs to be inhibited prior to power off, the operator who
authenticates the role must set the bands to the locked state again.

Section 4.1 – Roles and Authentication
This section describes roles, authentication method, and strength of authentication.

Table 6 ‐ Identification and Authentication Policy

The CM performs role authentication by comparing whether the PIN entered by the user
matches the information stored inside the CM. PINs are hashed with SHA2-256 to store them
on the CM. The PIN entered by the user is hashed and compared to the stored PIN hash.
PINs can be changed by executing the Set PIN Service (see Section4.2) with appropriate roles
authenticated. The CM refuses to set a PIN less than 8 bytes, and responds with an error if such
|     |     |     |     |     |     | 9   |     |     | Aug 29, 2024  |     |

a setting is attempted. Therefore, the probability that a random attempt will succeed is 1 / 264
< 1 / 1,000,000 (the CM accepts any value (0x00-0xFF) as each byte of PIN). The CM waits 1ms
when authentication attempt fails, so the maximum number of authentication attempts is
60,000 times in 1 min.  Therefore, the probability that random attempts in 1min will succeed is
60,000 / 264 < 1 / 100,000.
The Roles of AdminSP.Admin1, LockingSP.Admin2-4 and LockingSP.User1-192 are set initial
authentication data to null (means data of length 0). These role’s authentication data are need
to be replaced upon the first-time authentication. Otherwise, the operator who assumes these
roles cannot execute services except Set PIN and services that does not need authorized roles.

Section 6 – Operational Environment
Operational Environment requirements are not applicable because the CM does not employ
operating systems and operates in a non-modifiable environment that is the CM cannot be
modified and no code can be added or deleted. Any firmware/software loaded into this module
that is not shown on the module certificate, is out of the scope of this validation and requires a
success of firmware load test and a separate FIPS 140-3 validation.
Section 7 – Physical Security
The CM is a sub-chip enclosed in a single chip that is an opaque package. And the CM consists
of production-grade components. Gathering information of the module’s internal construction
or components is impossible without forcing the package to open. In this case, it is confirmed
package damage as a tamper-evidence. Operators of the CM can ensure that the physical
security is maintained to confirm the package has no obvious attack damage. If the operator
discovers tamper evidence, the CM should be removed.

is 5.67.
Table 10 ‐ Non-Deterministic Random Number Generation Specification
For the Entropy Source listed in the table above, self-tests are performed each time before data
is obtained (see Section 10 for details of these self-tests). When these tests detect that the
Entropy Source cannot generate the sufficient amount of entropy, the CM is transient to error
state. The CM can be recovered from the error state by rebooting the module, and the obtaining
of Entropy data is attempted again. If the CM continuously enters in error state in spite of
several trials of reboot, the CM may be sent back to factory to recover from error state.

The CM runs self-tests in the following table.

9 The Entropy Source is a hardware module inside the CM boundary. The Entropy Source
supplies the Hash_DRBG with 1024 bits entropy input. From Table 10 this input contains about
725 bits of entropy, which is sufficient entropy to obtain 256 bits of security strength.

Table 11 ‐ Self Tests

As shown in the table above, self-tests are performed automatically at the CM startup and
before execution certain security functions. Operator can also initiate self-test on-demand for
periodic testing by using the Reset service which is automatically invoked when the module is
powered-off and powered-on (rebooted).

10 Firmware load test
is also run at the time of Power-up, and the integrity of the Firmware
loaded into the CM can be confirmed.
|     | 19  |     |     | Aug 29, 2024  |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | ------------- | --- |

If the self-tests fail, the CM reports error status and enters to the error state. In this case, the
CM must be powered-off to clear error condition. When power-on is executed again, self-tests
are also executed like an on-demand operator reset. If the CM continuously enters in error state
in spite of several trials of reboot, the CM may be sent back to factory to recover from error
state.
Section 11 – Life-cycle Assurance
In the SSD’s manufacturing process, installation is executed as below:
1. The Firmware described in Section 2.1 is downloaded into the CM.
2. Initial SSPs are generated.
3. Initial authentication information is set to the CM.
4. System area including SSPs generated in Step2 and Step3 are encrypted and calculated
message authentication code.
Initial operations to setup this CM are following:
1. Load Firmware into the CM.
2. Load system area including SSPs into the CM.
3. Execute range state setting method.
4. Execute download port setting method.
5. Execute service execution state setting method.
6. Execute namespace setting method.
The CM switches to approved mode after the initial operation success. When the initial
operation succeeds, the CM indicates success on the Status Output interface. Operators can
confirm that the CM is in approved mode by executing Show Status service and checking that
the startup is successfully completed.
For secure operation, the following settings must be maintained:
 Data Locking Protection is Enabled
 Each Band is set to be locked when power-on. Bands that are not configured are considered
unprotected or plaintext.
(Refer to SSD setting procedure11)
11 For maintaining secure condition, the SSD needs several setting at least.
Owners of the SSD that embeds the CM must use it securely according to the followings:
1. TCG LockingSP is enabled by Activate method.
2. Both ReadLockEnabled and WriteLockEnabled are set to “True” for each band (included
GlobalRange) and it must not be modified.
20 Aug 29, 2024

As described in Section 2, the CM is used by being embedded in SSDs. Therefore, there are no
maintenance requirements for the CM alone. More detailed guidance for this module is provided
to the SSDs developers that embed the CM.
Section 12 – Mitigation of Other Attack
The CM does not mitigate other attacks beyond the scope of FIPS 140-3 requirements.
3. For each band, "Power Cycle" of LockOnReset setting is not change.
4. If the LockingSP has been made disabled, the Activate method is re-executed before
PowerCycle is performed.
