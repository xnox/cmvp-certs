1. General
The table below provides the security levels of the various sections of FIPS 140-3 in relation to the Palo Alto Networks
SD-WAN Virtual Instant-On Network (vION), hereinafter referred to as the Module or vION module.

The Palo Alto Networks SD-WAN Virtual Instant-On Network (vION) enables the integration of a diverse set of wide area
network (WAN) connection types, improves application performance and visibility, enhances security and compliance, and
reduces the overall cost and complexity of a WAN.  Built with the intent to reduce remote infrastructure, Palo Alto
Networks SD-WAN vION enables the cloud-delivered branch.  The vION module software version is 6.1.2.

Table 3 - Vendor Affirmed Operational Environments

Note: The vION comes in either ION 3108V or ION 7108V, which is the same functionality just with differences such as
throughput.

The CMVP makes no statement as to the correct operation of the module or the security strengths of the generated keys
when ported to an operational environment which is not listed on the validation certificate.

Modes of Operation
The module has one approved mode of operation and is always in approved mode of operation after initial operations are
performed (See Section 11). The module does not claim implementation of a degraded mode of operation. Section 4
provides details on the service indicator implemented by the module.

The tables below list all Approved or Vendor-affirmed security functions of the module, including specific key size(s) (in bits
unless noted otherwise) employed for Approved services, and implemented modes of operation. There are some algorithm
modes that were tested but not implemented by the module. Only the algorithms, modes, and key sizes that are
implemented by the module are shown in these tables.

Notes:

Table 5 - Approved Algorithms (Crypto Library – II)

●  The module’s AES-GCM implementation conforms to FIPS 140-3 IG C.H scenario #1 following RFC 5288 for TLS.

The module is compatible with TLSv1.2 and provides support for the acceptable GCM cipher suites from SP 800-
52 Rev1, Section 3.3.1. The operations of one of the two parties involved in the TLS key establishment scheme
were performed entirely within the cryptographic boundary of the module being validated. The counter portion of
the IV is set by the module within its cryptographic boundary. When the IV exhausts the maximum number of
possible values for a given session key, the first party, client or server, to encounter this condition will trigger a
handshake to establish a new encryption key. In case the module’s power is lost and then restored, a new key for
use with the AES GCM encryption/decryption shall be established.

●  No parts of the SSH, TLS, SNMP and IPSec/IKE protocols, other than the KDFs, have been tested by the CAVP

and CMVP.

As the module can only be operated in the Approved mode of operation with Approved algorithms noted in Tables 4 - 5
above, the following options defined in SP 800-140B are not applicable to this document:

●  Non-Approved Algorithms Allowed in Approved Mode of Operation
●  Non-Approved Algorithms Allowed in Approved Mode of Operation with No Security Claimed
●  Non-Approved Algorithms Not Allowed in Approved Mode of Operation

G = Generate: The module generates or derives the SSP.

R = Read: The SSP is read from the module (e.g. the SSP is output).

W = Write: The SSP is updated, imported, or written to the module.

E = Execute: The module uses the SSP in performing a cryptographic operation.

Z = Zeroise: The module zeroizes the SSP.

Unauthenticated Services
Unauthenticated Users can run the self-test service by power-cycling the module by removing the power and re-applying.

5. Software/Firmware Security
Integrity Techniques
The module performs the Software Integrity test by using HMAC-SHA2-256 (HMAC Cert. #A3566) during the Pre-
Operational Self-Test. A Software Integrity Test Key (non-SSP) was preloaded to the module’s binary at the factory and
used for software integrity test only at the pre-operational self-test.  At Module’s initialization, the integrity of the runtime
executable is verified using an HMAC-SHA2-256 digest which is compared to a value computed at build time.  If at the
load time the MAC does not match the stored, known MAC value, the module would enter an Error state with all crypto
functionality inhibited.

The module also supports the software load test by using RSA 2048 bits with SHA2-256 (RSA Cert. #A3566) for the new
validated software to be uploaded into the module.  A Software Load Test Key was preloaded to the module’s binary at the
factory and used for software load test.  In order to load new software, the Crypto Officer must authenticate into the
module before loading any software.  This ensures that unauthorized access and use of the module is not performed.  The
module will load the new update upon reboot.  The update attempt will be rejected if the verification fails

Integrity Test On-Demand
Integrity test is performed as part of the Pre-Operational Self-Tests.  It is automatically executed at power-on.  The
operator can power-cycle or reboot the module to initiate the software integrity test on-demand.  This automatically
performs the integrity test of all software components included within the boundary of the module.

6. Operational Environment
The module is a modifiable operational environment as per FIPS 140-3 Level 1 specifications.  The operating system is
restricted to a single operator mode of operation.  The application that makes calls to the module is the single user of the
modules even when the application is serving multiple clients. See Table 2 for details regarding what platforms the module
was tested on.

The software module provides a Software Update service.  The module’s validation to FIPS 140-3 is no longer valid once a
non-validated software is loaded.

7. Physical Security
As the module is a software only module, the physical security requirements are not applicable.

Periodic/On-Demand Self-Test
The module performs on-demand self-tests initiated by the operator, by power cycling or rebooting the tested platform.
The full suite of self-tests is then executed. The same procedure may be employed by the operator to perform periodic
self-tests.

It is recommended that the Crypto Officer perform periodic testing of the module’s on-demand self-tests every 60 days to
ensure all components are functioning correctly.

Error Handling
If any of the above-mentioned self-tests fail, the module reports the cause of the error and enters an error state (there is
only one error state).  In the Error State, no cryptographic services are provided, and data output is prohibited.  The only
method to recover from the error state is to reboot the module and perform the self-tests, including the pre-operational
software integrity test and the conditional CASTs.  The module will only enter into the operational state after successfully
passing the pre-operational software integrity test and the conditional CASTs.  The table below shows the different causes
that lead to the Error State and the status indicators reported.

Cause of Error
Failed Pre-Operational Software Integrity Test
Failed Conditional CAST

Failed Conditional PCT
Failed Software Load Test
SP 800-90B Entropy Source
Start-up/Continuous health tests

Error State Indicator
Integrity check failed at <location>
<Crypto Library>: FIPS Self-test failed for <algorithm> Entering
error state
Key verification failed
Verification Failure
No random numbers are generated and key generation is
halted

11. Life-Cycle Assurance
The module is designed to handle the various stages of a module’s life-cycle.  The sections below highlight the details for
each stage.

Secure Delivery Procedures
Software is available on Palo Alto Networks’ support site, which uses TLS 1.2 during the download process.  The support
site also provides a SHA2-256 checksum that Crypto Officers can use to verify the integrity of the module once it has been
transferred/downloaded.

Secure Operation
The module meets all the Level 1 requirements for FIPS 140-3.  Follow the secure operations provided below to place the
module in the Approved mode.

The software version is 6.1.2, which is the only allowable software image for this current approved mode of operation.
The module is initiated into the Approved mode of operation via the following procedure:

1.

Install the vION on the platform

2.  Using the Controller, navigate to the device that is to be initiated

3.  Select “FIPS”

a.  Click “proceed” to begin initialization procedure

4.  The module will begin initialization that includes the following:

a.  Zeroization of any sensitive information or data

b.  Power cycle of the device followed by running all self-tests

5.  Once initialization is complete, the module provides the following status output:

a.  Device Mode: “fips”

b.  Self-tests: “Power-up self test successful”

Once the module has completed initialization into the Approved mode of operation, any non-Approved
configurations/algorithms are rejected automatically by the module and an error message is output.

End of Life / Sanitization
End of life dates for software and hardware modules are announced publicly via Palo Alto Networks’ services website.
Crypto Officers should follow the procedure below for the secure destruction of their module:

Note: This process will cause the module to no longer function after it has wiped all configurations and keys.

1.  Access the module as Crypto Officer
2.  Execute command: “disable system”
a.  Confirm command

3.  Module will begin zeroization process and wipe all security parameters and configurations

12. Mitigation of Other Attacks
This module is not designed to mitigate against any other attacks outside of the FIPS 140-3 scope.
