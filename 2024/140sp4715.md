Table 3 – Vendor Affirmed Operational Environments

The CMVP makes no statement as to the correct operation of the module or the security strengths of the generated keys
when ported to an operational environment which is not listed on the validation certificate.

Modes of Operation
The module has one approved mode of operation and is always in approved mode of operation after initial operations are
performed (See Section 11). The module does not claim implementation of a degraded mode of operation. Section 4
provides details on the service indicator implemented by the module.

The tables below list all Approved or Vendor-affirmed security functions of the module, including specific key size(s) (in bits
unless noted otherwise) employed for Approved services, and implemented modes of operation.  There are some algorithm
modes that were tested but not implemented by the module.  Only the algorithms, modes, and key sizes that are
implemented by the module are shown in these tables.

Table 5 – Approved Algorithms (Crypto Library – II)

Notes:

●  The module’s AES-GCM implementation conforms to FIPS 140-3 IG C.H scenario #1 following RFC 5288 for TLS.

The module is compatible with TLSv1.2 and provides support for the acceptable GCM cipher suites from SP 800-
52 Rev1, Section 3.3.1.  The operations of one of the two parties involved in the TLS key establishment scheme
were performed entirely within the cryptographic boundary of the module being validated.  The counter portion of
the IV is set by the module within its cryptographic boundary.  When the IV exhausts the maximum number of
possible values for a given session key, the first party, client or server, to encounter this condition will trigger a
handshake to establish a new encryption key.  In case the module’s power is lost and then restored, a new key for
use with the AES GCM encryption/decryption shall be established.

●  No parts of the SSH, TLS, SNMP and IPSec/IKE protocols, other than the KDFs, have been tested by the CAVP

and CMVP.

G = Generate: The module generates or derives the SSP.

R = Read: The SSP is read from the module (e.g. the SSP is output).

W = Write: The SSP is updated, imported, or written to the module.

E = Execute: The module uses the SSP in performing a cryptographic operation.

Z = Zeroise: The module zeroizes the SSP.

Unauthenticated Services
Unauthenticated Users can run the self-test service by power-cycling the tested platform.

5. Software/Firmware Security
Integrity Techniques
The module performs the Software Integrity test by using HMAC-SHA2-256 (HMAC Cert. #A3566) during the Pre-
Operational Self-Test. A Software Integrity Test Key (non-SSP) was preloaded to the module’s binary at the factory and
used for firmware integrity test only at the pre-operational self-test.  At Module’s initialization, the integrity of the runtime
executable is verified using an HMAC-SHA2-256 digest which is compared to a value computed at build time.  If at the
load time the MAC does not match the stored, known MAC value, the module would enter an Error state with all crypto
functionality inhibited.

Integrity Test On-Demand
Integrity test is performed as part of the Pre-operational self-tests.  It is automatically executed at power-on.  The operator
can power-cycle or reboot the module to initiate the software integrity test on-demand.  This automatically performs the
integrity test of all firmware components included within the boundary of the module.

6. Operational Environment
The module is a modifiable operational environment as per FIPS 140-3 Level 1 specifications.  The operating system is
restricted to a single operator mode of operation.  The application that makes calls to the module is the single user of the
module even when the application is serving multiple clients.

See Table 2 for details regarding what platforms the module was tested on.

7. Physical Security
As the module is a software only module, the physical security requirements are not applicable.

8. Non-Invasive Security
No approved non-invasive attack mitigation test metrics are defined at this time.

Periodic/On-Demand Self-Test
The module performs on-demand self-tests initiated by the operator, by power cycling or rebooting the tested platform.
The full suite of self-tests is then executed. The same procedure may be employed by the operator to perform periodic
self-tests.

It is recommended that the Crypto Officer perform periodic testing of the module’s on-demand self-tests every 60 days to
ensure all components are functioning correctly.

Error Handling
If any of the above-mentioned self-tests fail, the module reports the cause of the error and enters an error state (there is
only one error state).  In the Error State, no cryptographic services are provided, and data output is prohibited.  The only
method to recover from the error state is to reboot the module and perform the self-tests, including the pre-operational
software integrity test and the conditional CASTs.  The module will only enter into the operational state after successfully

11. Life-Cycle Assurance
The sections below highlight the details for each stage.

Secure Delivery Procedures
The module is built into ION 6.1.  There is no standalone delivery of the module as a software library.  The vendor’s
internal development process guarantees that the correct version of the module goes with the intended OS.

Secure Operation
The module meets all the Level 1 requirements for FIPS 140-3.  Follow the secure operations provided below to place the
module in the Approved mode.

The software version is 1.0.  The module is initiated into the Approved mode of operation via the following procedure.
Note that a Palo Alto ION device running ION 6.1 is needed to access the APIs of the module.

1.  Prepare ION device for use and power-on

2.  Using the Controller, navigate to the device that is to be initiated

3.  Select “FIPS”

a.  Click “proceed” to begin initialization procedure

4.  The module will begin initialization that includes the following:

a.  Zeroization of any sensitive information or data

b.  Power cycle of the device followed by running all self-tests

5.  Once initialization is complete, the module provides the following status output:

a.  Device Mode: “fips”

b.  Self-tests: “Power-up self test successful”

Once the module has completed initialization into the Approved mode of operation, any non-Approved
configurations/algorithms are rejected automatically by the module and an error message is output.

End of Life / Sanitization
End of life dates for the module are announced publicly via Palo Alto Networks’ services website.  Crypto Officers should
follow the procedure below for the secure destruction of their module:

Note: This process will cause the module to no longer function after it has wiped all configurations and keys.

1.  Access the module as Crypto Officer
2.  Execute command: “disable system”
a.  Confirm command

3.  Module will begin zeroization process and wipe all security parameters and configurations

12. Mitigation of Other Attacks
This module is not designed to mitigate against any other attacks outside of the FIPS 140-3 scope.
