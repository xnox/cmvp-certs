Mode of operation

When the module starts up successfully, after passing the pre-operational self-test and the cryptographic
algorithms self-tests (CASTs), the module is operating in the approved mode of operation by default and
can only be transitioned into the non-approved mode by calling one of the non-approved services listed in
Table 9. Section 4 provides details on the service indicator is implemented by the module.  The service
indicator identifies when an approved service is called. The Crypto Officer shall not configure the use of
non-approved algorithms while the module is operating in an approved mode. If a non-Approved algorithm
is used, then the module is operating in a non-Approved mode. Prior to using any of the non-approved
services, the Crypto Officer shall zeroize all CSPs which places the module into the non-approved mode of
operation.

Table 3 below lists all Approved or Vendor-affirmed security functions of the module, including specific key
size(s) -in bits unless otherwise noted- employed for approved services, and implemented modes of
operation.  There are algorithms, modes, and key moduli sizes that have been CAVP-tested but are not
used by any approved services of the module.  Only the algorithms, modes/methods, and key
lengths/curves/moduli shown in the tables below are used by an approved service of the module.

5.  Software security

Integrity techniques

The module is software-only and performs self-tests during the loading of the module to ensure the
integrity of the module and its services.  To ensure software security, the module is protected by an HMAC-
SHA2-256 (HMAC Cert. #A2268) algorithm.  The software integrity test key (non-SSP) was preloaded to the
module’s binary at the factory and used only for the pre-operational software integrity self-test.  During
initialization of the module, the integrity of the runtime executable is verified using an HMAC-SHA2-256
which is compared to a value computed at build time.  If at load time the MAC does not match the stored,
known MAC value, the module enters a critical error state where all crypto functionality is inhibited.  The
module must be reloaded to attempt the integrity test again.

Integrity test on-demand

The integrity test is performed as part of the Pre-Operational Self-Tests.  It is automatically executed at
power-on.  The operator can power-cycle or reboot the tested platform to initiate the integrity test on-
demand.

6.  Operational environment

The module is operated in a modifiable operational environment per the definition in FIPS 140-3.  The
operation system shall be restricted to a single operator mode of operation (i.e., concurrent operators are
explicitly excluded).  The external application calling the module is a single user of the cryptographic
module, even when the application is serving multiple clients.

7.  Physical security

The module is software-only and so does not claim any physical security.

8.  Non-invasive security

The module claims no non-invasive security techniques.

Random number generation
The module implements an Approved SP 800-90Ar1 DRBG (HMAC-DRBG Cert. #A2268), which shall be
called by the Application Client for key generation.

Key generation
The module does not provide any key generation service or perform key generation for any of its
Approved algorithms.  Keys/CSPs are passed in from calling applications via the algorithm API
parameters.

Key entry and output
The module does not support manual key entry or key output.  Keys/CSPs can only be exchanged
between the module and the calling application via the appropriate algorithm API calls within the
TOEPP.

Key storage
The SSPs are not stored inside the module.  A pointer to a plaintext key is passed to the module through
the algorithm APIs.  Intermediate key/CSP storage locations are immediately zeroized in memory after
use.

Key zeroization
The module is passed keys as part of a function call from a calling application and does not store keys
persistently.    All SSPs can be zeroized by powering down the tested platform.

Minimum number
of bits of entropy

Details

0.908 bits/sample bit  CPU Jitter Random Number Generator (Jitter
Entropy Library v2.2.0) from Stephen Muller
provides at least 256 bits 256-bits of security
strength entropy. Please see
https://www.chronox.de/jent/doc/CPU-Jitter-
NPTRNG.pdf for more information.

The entropy source falls into IG 9.3.A, Scenario
#1(b): A software module that contains an
approved DRBG, that is seeded exclusively from
one or more known entropy sources, located
within the physical perimeter of the operational
environment.

Table 11- Non-Deterministic Random Number Generation Specification

10. Self-tests

When the module is loaded or instantiated (after being powered off, rebooted, etc.), the module runs pre-
operational self-tests.  The operating system is responsible for the initialization process and loading of the
library.  The module is designed with a default entry point (DEP) which ensures that the self-tests are
initiated automatically when the module is loaded.  Prior to the module providing any data output via the
data output interface, the module would perform and pass the pre-operational self-tests.  Following the
successful pre-operational self-tests, the module would execute the Conditional Cryptographic Algorithm
Self-tests (CASTs).

©2024 Google, LLC. This document can be reproduced and distributed only whole and intact, including this copyright notice.

9

The self-test success or failure is output as a return value of the library load API call, which is functioning as
the self-test status indicator.  If one of the self-tests fails, the module transitions into the error state (there
is only one error state if any one of self-tests fails) and outputs the error message via the module’s status
output interface.  While the module is in the error state, all data through the data output interface and all
cryptographic operations are disabled.  The error state can only be cleared by reloading the module.  All
self-tests must be completed successfully before the module transitions to the operational state.

Below are the details of the self-tests conducted by the module.

Pre-operational self-test

•  HMAC-SHA2-256 KAT

•  Software Integrity Test (using HMAC-SHA256)

During the build-time the hash value is calculated over the module (the original code and read-only data of
the fips140.ko file).  To calculate the hash of the loaded module, the segments of the code are
concatenated to each other with the relocations unapplied.  The hash of this code is then calculated and
compared to the build-time hash value.  If the value does not match the module will enter the error state.

Conditional algorithm self-tests
After the successful Pre-operational self-tests, the module will perform Conditional algorithm self-tests
(CASTs).  The following Known Answer Tests (KATs) are performed, automatically and without any
intervention.  Any failure of a KAT will result in the module entering the error state.
•  AES-ECB Encryption KAT (128 bits), PAA and non-PAA tested separately
•  AES-ECB Decryption KAT (128 bits), PAA and non-PAA tested separately
•  AES-CCB Encryption KAT (128 bits), PAA and non-PAA tested separately
•  AES-CBC Decryption KAT (128 bits), PAA and non-PAA tested separately
•  AES-XTS Encryption KAT (128 bits), PAA and non-PAA tested separately
•  AES-XTS Decryption KAT (128 bits), PAA and non-PAA tested separately
•  AES-CMAC Encryption KAT (128 bits), PAA and non-PAA tested separately
•  AES-CMAC Decryption KAT (128 bits), PAA and non-PAA tested separately
•  DRBG Instantiate KAT, PAA and non-PAA tested separately
•  DRBG Generate KAT, PAA and non-PAA tested separately
•  DRBG Reseed KAT, PAA and non-PAA tested separately
•  Note:  DRBG Health Tests as specified in SP800-90Arev1 Section 11.3 are performed)
•  HMAC-SHA-1 KAT, PAA and non-PAA tested separately
•  HMAC-SHA2-256 KAT, PAA and non-PAA tested separately
•  HMAC-SHA2-512 KAT, PAA and non-PAA tested separately
•  SHA-1 KAT, PAA and non-PAA tested separately
•  SHA2-256 KAT, PAA and non-PAA tested separately
•  SHA2-512 KAT, PAA and non-PAA tested separately

In addition, the module’s entropy source also conducts the following entropy health tests:

Entropy source health tests
1.  ENT (NP) SP800-90B start-up health tests:

•  Repetition Count Test (RCT)
•  Adaptive Proportion Test (APT)

Note: Please refer to SP800-90B, sections 4.4.1 and 4.4.2 for more information about the RCT and APT.

2.  ENT (NP) SP800-90B continuous health tests:

•  Repetition Count Test (RCT)
•  Adaptive Proportion Test (APT)

Periodic/on-demand self-test
The module performs on-demand self-tests initiated by the operator, by power cycling or rebooting the
tested platform.  The full suite of self-tests is then executed.  The same procedure may be employed by the
operator to perform periodic self-tests.

It is recommended that the User perform periodic testing of the module’s on-demand self-tests every 60
days to ensure all components are functioning correctly.

Error handling
If any one of the above-mentioned self-tests fails, including pre-operational self-test, CASTs, entropy source
health tests, the module enters the Error state (there is only one error state).  In the case of the module
entering the Error State, the module sends a kernel panic signal to the kernel causing a reboot, preventing
access to any non cryptographic services or data output from the module.  The only method to recover
from the error state is to reboot the module (triggered automatically by the kernel panic), and then pass
the self-tests, including the pre-operational software integrity test and the conditional CASTs again.  The
module will only enter into the operational state after successfully passing the pre-operational software
integrity test and the conditional CASTs.

11. Life-cycle assurance

Secure initialization and startup
The module is initialized during the loading of the module before any cryptographic functionality is
available.  The operating system is responsible for the initialization and loading processes of the module.
The module is designed with constructor (default entry point of the module) which ensures that the
Cryptographic Algorithm Self-Tests (CASTs) and Pre-operational Self-Test are initiated automatically
when the module is loaded.

Secure operation
The module is provided directly to solution developers and is not intended for direct download by the
general public.  The module is installed on an operating system (Linux kernel) specified in Section 2.

Additional Rules of Operation:

1.  The writable memory areas of the module (data and stack segments) are accessible only by the

kernel itself so that the operating system is in "single user" mode.  The module does not support
concurrent operators.

2.  The operating system is responsible for multitasking operations so that other processes cannot

access the address space of the process containing the module.

3.  Only the approved services defined in Section 4 above shall be used in approved mode of operation.

4.  The length of a single data unit encrypted or decrypted with the AES-XTS shall not exceed 2²⁰ AES
blocks; that is, 16 MB of data per AES-XTS instance. An XTS instance is defined in section 4 of NIST
SP 800-38E.

5.  The AES-XTS mode shall only be used for the cryptographic protection of data on storage devices.
The AES-XTS shall not be used for other purposes, such as the encryption of data in transit. The
module implements the check to ensure that the two AES keys used in the XTS-AES algorithm are
not identical

The module is not distributed as a standalone library as an Android developer must integrate the
module into the Android system image.

The end user of the operating system is also responsible for zeroizing SSPs via powering down the
tested platform that the module executes on to zeroize all SSPs used by the module.

Configuration management
The source code for the module is maintained in a git repository.  While in process work on the code is
maintained internally, code is eventually released to https://ci.android.com where it can be accessed
by anyone.  The source code manifest includes a build configuration providing a list of the specific tools
needed to reproduce the module.  The version number is generated by git based on the commit
automatically.

Documentation related to the module is maintained in Google Docs.  All documents (whether
spreadsheets, documents, presentations or anything else) are automatically version tracked along with
the owner.  Like git, Docs uses access control lists to control access to the design documentation for the
module.

Delivery and operation
The module is released as source code for other users to utilize as needed, but the module is only
tested on the specific devices listed in section 2.  Google follows the same build steps to produce the
binary version of the module as laid out in the configuration management solution when creating the
software that will be installed on the device.  The build process is strictly controlled within Google,
including access controls on the generation and certification of the builds to be used on a device for
production.

The module is a built-in component of the overall Linux kernel image that is installed on the devices
under test.  The binary image produced from the build process is then installed onto the mobile devices
at the factory, or updated via the device update process (OTA, or Over-the-Air updates).  OTA updates
follow the same build requirements as a factory installed image (which includes the module), but can
be delivered after the device is purchased and in customer hands.  All builds are signed and checked by
the device (using checks burned into one-time fuses in the processor) to ensure that unauthorized
binaries cannot be installed.

12. Mitigation of other attacks

The module does not claim mitigation of other attacks.
