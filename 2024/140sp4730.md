Introduction
Federal Information Processing Standards Publication 140-3 — Security Requirements for Cryptographic
Modules specifies requirements for cryptographic modules to be deployed in a Sensitive but Unclassified
environment. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and Canadian Centre for Cyber
Security (CCCS) Cryptographic Module Validation Program (CMVP) run the FIPS 140 program. The NVLAP
accredits independent testing labs to perform FIPS 140 testing; the CMVP validates modules meeting FIPS
140 validation. Validated is the term given to a module that is documented and tested against the FIPS
140 criteria.
More information is available on the CMVP website at:

2.  Cryptographic Module Specification
The module is a firmware-based cryptographic module that runs on a Motorola Solutions, Inc. radio
hardware platform. The module provides FIPS 140-3 approved cryptographic functionalities via an
Application Programming Interface (API) to the application layer running in Motorola Solutions, Inc. radio
products supporting the APCO Project 25 standard.
The module is intended for use by the markets that require FIPS 140-3 validated overall Security Level 1.
A unique binary is generated for each operating system.  The following operating environments have been
tested for this validation:

Table 3 – Vendor Affirmed Operational Environments
2.1  Modes of Operation
The module operates in two different modes of operation.
•  Approved mode: DES Encrypt/Decrypt are blocked. All services listed in Table 9 are available
when the module is operating in Approved mode.
•  non-Approved mode: All services listed in Table 9 and Table 10 are available when the module
is operating in non-Approved mode.

The module defaults to the Approved mode at the initial power-up and will transition between Approved
Mode and non-Approved mode by using the “Configure Approved Mode” service.  The operator can
configure the mode of the module by using the “Configure Approved Mode” Service listed in Table 9.   The
“Configure Approved Mode” services sets an Approved mode flag via the API. The Approved mode flag is
“fips_mode = 1” in the Approved mode and the non-Approved mode flag is “fips_mode = 0”.  The operator
shall zeroize all CSPs by power cycling the module when transitioning between Approved and non-
Approved modes. The operator must retain control of the module while zeroization is in process.

2.4 Security Rules and Guidance
The module enforces the following security rules:
1. The module does not support any operator authentication.
2. The module is available to perform services only after successfully completing the pre-operational
self-tests.
3. Data output is inhibited during pre-operational self-tests, zeroization, and while in an error state.
4. The module shall not support concurrent operators.
5. The module enters the uninitialized state if any pre-operational self-test fail. The uninitialized
state can be exited by restarting the module allowing the module to attempt to re-initialize itself.
6. If the module enters a soft error state, the error condition may be cleared by executing the
Operator Initiated Self-Test service documented in Section 11.2 or power cycling the module.
7. The module can perform periodic self-tests. An operator can perform periodic self-tests on
demand by using the Operator Initiated Self-Test API or power cycle.
8. The module does not perform any cryptographic functions while in the uninitialized state.
9. The module returns the results of the pre-operational self-tests to the operator.
10. The module may be power cycled to zeroize all CSPs.
11. The module is to be installed on Motorola Solutions radio products.
12. The operator may choose whether the module will run in the Approved mode or non-Approved
mode using the “Configure Approved Mode” Service.
3. Cryptographic Module Interfaces
The Module’s logical interfaces are described in Table 7:

4.  Roles, Services, and Authentication
The module supports the Cryptographic Officer (CO) role and does not support authentication. An
operator is considered the owner of the thread that instantiates the module and, therefore, only one
concurrent operator is allowed.

4 The Zeroize service zeroizes the key in the volatile memory by power cycling the module.
5 As per NIST SP 800-132, keys generated by the module shall be used as recommend in Section 5.4 of [132]. Any
other use of the approved PBKDF is non‐conformant. In approved mode the operator shall enter a password no less
than 8 hexadecimal digits in length. The probability of guessing the password will be equal to 1:168. Due to the
computational limitations of this embedded operational environment, the iteration count associated with the PBKDF
should not exceed 5000. The minimum iteration count is 1, however it shall be selected as large as possible.  Keys
derived from passwords may only be used in storage applications.

5. Software/Firmware Security
The module consists of firmware in the form of a statically linked library. The firmware components are
protected and authenticated using an HMAC hash function using the keyed hash key referenced in Table
11. The operator can initiate the firmware integrity test (HMAC-SHA2-384) on demand by power cycling
the radio. If the integrity test fails, the module will not initialize and no security functions will be provided
by the module.
6. Operational Environment
The module operates and was tested on the following non-modifiable operational environment:
Motorola Solutions, Inc. Radio using hardware platform as specified in Table 2.
As per ISO/IEC 19790:2012 7.6.3:
• The cryptographic module has control over its own SSPs.
• The operational environment provides the capability to separate individual application processes
from each other to prevent uncontrolled access to CSPs and uncontrolled modifications of SSPs,
regardless if this data is in the process memory or stored on persistent storage within the
operational environment. This ensures that direct access to CSPs and SSPs is restricted to the
cryptographic module and the trusted parts of the operational environment.
• The module operates in a non-modifiable operational environment, therefore no restrictions or
modifications to the configuration of the operational environment are possible.
• Processes that are spawned by the cryptographic module are owned by the module and are not
owned by external processes/operators.
7. Physical Security
The module is a firmware module and operates in a Motorola Solutions, In. radio that is built with
production grade materials that include standard passivation techniques. For the purposes of FIPS 140-

3, the embodiment is defined as multiple-chip standalone and is designed to meet Level 1 security
requirements.
8.  Non-invasive Security
Not Applicable. The module does not implement non-invasive security measures.

entropy
Entropy Input String  384 (minimum seed length  The entropy for seeding the SP 800-90Ar1
for AES-256 CTR_DRBG)  DRBG is determined by the user operator of
the module which is outside of the module’s
cryptographic boundary. To be compliant, the
target application shall supply at least 384 bits
of entropy in order to meet the security
strength required for the random number
generation mechanism as shown in [SP 800-
90Ar1] Table 3 (CTR_DRBG) and set required
bits into the module by calling module defined
API function. Since entropy is loaded passively
into the module, there is no assurance of the
minimum strength of generated keys.

Self-Tests
10.1  Automatic Self-Test
The module automatically performs pre-operational self-tests and conditional cryptographic algorithm
self-tests. Automatic pre-operational self-tests are initiated upon module power-up and must pass in
order for the module to initialize and render any security services. A failure of any pre-operational self-
test will prevent the module from initializing. Automatic conditional cryptographic algorithm self-tests
(CAST) will run prior to the first use of a security service using an approved cryptographic algorithm after
module initialization.  Failure of a conditional CAST will cause the module to enter the soft error state and
return an error to the operator of the module.

o ECDSA Key Gen PCT (384-bit private key, 384-bit public key)
10.2 Operator Initiated Self-Test
Self-tests can also be initiated by calling the “Self-Test” service via the API. Operator initiated self-tests via
the API can only be invoked after the module has initialized. When initiating self-test via API call, the
following tests are performed:
• SHA2-256 CAST
• SHA2-512 CAST
• HMAC-SHA2-384 CAST
• AES ECB Encrypt CASTs (256-bit key)
• AES ECB Decrypt CASTs (256-bit key)
• AES GCM Encrypt CASTs (256-bit key)
• AES GCM Decrypt CASTs (256-bit key)
• CTR_DRBG [SP 800-90Ar1] CAST (Instantiate, Generate, and Reseed)
• AES-KW [SP 800-38F] Wrap CAST
• AES-KW [SP 800-38F] Unwrap CAST
• KAS ECC [SP 800-56ar3] CAST
• KDF [SP 800-56Arev3] CAST (SHA2-256, SHA2-384, SHA2-512)
• PBKDF [SP 800-132] CAST (128-bit key, 128-bit salt, 2 iterations)
• ECDSA Key Gen PCT (384-bit private key, 384-bit public key)
Failure of any of the self-test initiated by calling the “Self-Test” service via the API will render the module
inoperable.
11. Life-Cycle Assurance
The cryptographic module is not installed, but it is a static library linked to the application at
compile time. The operator shall configure the module to operate in approved mode as specified
in Section 2.1. After end-of-life for the module, the operator shall zeroize all SSPs used by the
module by removing power to the radio using the module.
