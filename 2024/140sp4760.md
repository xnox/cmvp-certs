Purpose

Palo Alto Networks offers a full line of next-generation security appliances that range from the PA-220, designed for
enterprise remote ofﬁces, to the PA-7080, which is a modular chassis designed for high-speed datacenters. Our
platform architecture is based on our single-pass engine, PAN-OS, for networking, security, threat prevention, and
management functionality that is consistent across all platforms. The devices differ only in capacities, performance,
and physical conﬁguration.

The Palo Alto Networks PA-220, PA-220R, PA-400 Series, PA-800 Series, PA-3200 Series, PA-3400 Series, PA-5200
Series, PA-5400 Series, PA-5450,  and PA-7000 Series NGFWs (hereafter referred to as the modules) are multi-chip
standalone modules that provide network security by enabling enterprises to see and control applications, users,
and content – not just ports, IP addresses, and packets – using three unique identiﬁcation technologies: App-ID,
User-ID, and Content-ID. These identiﬁcation technologies, found in Palo Alto Networks' enterprise ﬁrewalls, enable
enterprises to create business-relevant security policies – safely enabling organizations to adopt new applications,
instead of the traditional “all-or-nothing” approach offered by traditional port-blocking ﬁrewalls used in many
security infrastructures.

Features and Beneﬁts

●  Application visibility and control: Accurate identiﬁcation of the applications traversing the network enables
policy-based control over application usage at the ﬁrewall, the strategic center of the security infrastructure.
●  Visualization tools: Graphical visibility tools, customizable reporting and logging enables administrators to make a

more informed decision on how to treat the applications traversing the network.

●  Application browser: Helps administrators quickly research what the application is, its behavioral characteristics
and underlying technology resulting in a more informed decision making process on how to treat the application.
●  User-based visibility and control: Seamless integration with enterprise directory services (Active Directory, LDAP,
eDirectory) facilitates application visibility and policy creation based on user and group information, not just IP
address. In Citrix and terminal services environments, the identity of users sitting behind Citrix or terminal services
can be used to enable policy-based visibility and control over applications, users and content. An XML API enables
integration with other, 3rd party user repositories.

●  Real-time threat prevention: Detects and blocks application vulnerabilities, viruses, spyware, and worms; controls

web activity; all in real-time, dramatically improving performance and accuracy.

●  File and data ﬁltering: Taking full advantage of the in-depth application inspection being performed by App-ID,

administrators can implement several different types of policies that reduce the risk associated with unauthorized
ﬁle and data transfer.

●  Legacy ﬁrewall support: Support for traditional inbound and outbound port-based ﬁrewall rules mixed with

application-based rules smooth the transition to a Palo Alto Networks next generation ﬁrewall.

●  Networking architecture: Support for dynamic routing (OSPF, RIP, BGP), virtual wire mode and layer 2/layer 3

modes facilitates deployment in nearly any networking environment.

●  Policy-based Forwarding: Forward trafﬁc based on policy deﬁned by application, source zone/interface,

source/destination address, source user/group, and service.

●  Virtual Systems: Create multiple virtual “ﬁrewalls” within a single device as a means of supporting speciﬁc
departments or customers. Each virtual system can include dedicated administrative accounts, interfaces,
networking conﬁguration, security zones, and policies for the associated network trafﬁc.

●  VPN connectivity: Secure site-to-site connectivity is enabled through standards-based IPSec VPN support while

remote user access is delivered via SSL VPN connectivity.

●  Quality of Service (QoS): Deploy trafﬁc shaping policies (guaranteed, maximum and priority) to enable positive

policy controls over bandwidth intensive, non-work related applications such as streaming media while preserving
the performance of business applications.

●  Real-time bandwidth monitor: View real-time bandwidth and session consumption for applications and users within

a selected QoS class.

●  Purpose-built platform: combines single pass engine with parallel processing hardware to deliver the multi-Gbps

performance necessary to protect today’s high-speed networks.

Approved Mode of Operation
The following procedure will put the modules into the Approved mode of operation:

●

Install physical kit opacity shields and tamper evidence seals according to the Physical Security Policy section.
Physical kits must be correctly installed to operate in the Approved mode of operation. The tamper evidence seals
and opacity shields shall be installed for the module to operate in the Approved mode of operation.

●  During initial boot up, break the boot sequence via the console port connection (by pressing the maint button when

instructed to do so) to access the main menu.

●  Select “Continue.”
●  Select the “Set FIPS-CC Mode” option to enter the Approved mode.
●  Select “Enable FIPS-CC Mode”.
●  When prompted, select “Reboot” and the module will re-initialize and continue into “FIPS-CC” mode (Approved

mode).

●  The module will reboot.
●
●  Once the module has ﬁnished booting, the Crypto Ofﬁcer can authenticate using the default credentials that come

In “FIPS-CC” mode, the console port is available as a status output port.

with the module

o  Once authenticated, the module will automatically require the operator to change their password; and the

default credential is overwritten

The module will automatically indicate the Approved mode of operation in the following manner:

●  Status output interface will indicate “**** FIPS-CC MODE ENABLED ****” via the CLI session.
●  Status output interface will indicate “FIPS-CC mode enabled successfully” via the console port.
●  The module will display “FIPS-CC” at all times in the status bar at the bottom of the web interface.

Should one or more power-up self-tests fail, the Approved mode of operation will not be achieved.  Feedback will consist of:

●  The module will output “FIPS-CC failure”
●  The module will reboot and enter a state in which the reason for the reboot can be determined.
●  To determine which self-test caused the system to reboot into the error state, connect the console cable and follow

the on-screen instructions to view the self-test output.

Note: Disabling FIPS-CC mode causes a complete factory reset, which is described in the Zeroization section below.

Page 6

Non-Compliant State

Failure to follow the directions in the Approved Mode of Operation above and Section 11 will result in the module operating
in a non-compliant state.

Zeroization

The following procedure will zeroize the module:

●  Access the module’s CLI via SSH, and command the module to enter maintenance mode; the module will reboot

o  Note: Establish a serial connection to the console port

●  After reboot, select “Continue.”
●  Select “Factory Reset”
●  The module will perform a zeroization, and provide the following message once complete:

o  “Factory Reset Status: Success”

**The module is compliant to IG C.H: GCM is used in the context of TLS, IPsec/IKEv2, SSH:

●  For TLS, The GCM implementation meets Scenario 1 of IG C.H: it is used in a manner compliant with SP
800-52 and in accordance with Section 4 of RFC 5288 for TLS key establishment. During operational
testing, the module was tested against an independent version of TLS and found to behave correctly.

o  From this RFC, the GCM cipher suites in use are

TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256,
TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384,
TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256, and
TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384.

●  For IPsec/IKEv2, The GCM implementation meets Scenario 1 of IG C.H: it is used in a manner compliant
with RFCs 4106 and 7296 (RFC 5282 is not applicable, as the module does not use GCM within IKEv2
itself). During operational testing, the module was tested against an independent version of IPsec with
IKEv2 and found to behave correctly.

●  For SSH, the module meets Scenario 4 of IG C.H. The ﬁxed ﬁeld is 32 bits in length and is derived using the
SSH KDF; this ensures the ﬁxed ﬁeld is unique for any given GCM session. The invocation ﬁeld is 64 bits in
length and is incremented for each invocation of GCM; this prevents the IV from repeating until the
entire invocation ﬁeld space of 264 is exhausted. (It would take hundreds of years for this to occur.)

In all of the above cases, the nonce_explicit is always generated deterministically. AES GCM keys are zeroized when
the module is power-cycled. For each new TLS or SSH session, a new AES GCM key is established.

The module is compliant to IG C.F:
The module utilizes approved modulus sizes 2048, 3072, and 4096 bits for RSA signatures. This functionality has
been CAVP tested as noted above. The minimum number of Miller Rabin tests for each modulus size is implemented
according to Table C.2 of FIPS 186-4. For modulus size 4096 the module implements the largest number of
Miller-Rabin tests shown in Table C.2. RSA SigVer is CAVP tested for all three supported modulus sizes as noted
above. The module does not perform FIPS 186-2 SigVer. All supported modulus sizes are CAVP testable and tested
as noted above. The module does not implement RSA key transport in the approved mode.

The module does not have any algorithms that fall under:

-  Non-Approved Algorithms Allowed in the Approved Mode of Operation
-  Non-Approved Algorithms Allowed in the Approved Mode of Operation with No Security Claimed
-  Non-Approved Algorithms Not Allowed in the Approved Mode of Operation

The following table documents the module’s algorithms that are non-approved and not allowed for use in the approved mode
of operation.

Assumption of Roles
The modules support four distinct operator roles, User and Cryptographic Ofﬁcer (CO), Remote Access VPN, and Site-to-site
VPN. The cryptographic modules enforce the separation of roles using unique authentication credentials associated with
operator accounts. The modules support concurrent operators.

The modules do not provide a maintenance role or bypass capability.

The modules all support the use of a password (i.e. Memorized Secret as per SP 800-140E).  Upon ﬁrst boot, the module
requires that the Cryptographic Ofﬁcer change the password from the default one to a custom one.  The module
automatically enforces a minimum password length of at least 8 characters.  In FIPS-CC mode, the module automatically
enforces a maximum of 10 failed attempts.  Passwords stored in the module are hashed using SHA-256, and any passwords
that are transported into/out of the module are protected via TLS 1.2.

The passwords for the RA VPN and S-S VPN roles are created as part of the Security Conﬁguration Management service
allocated to the Cryptographic Ofﬁcer.

Password-based
The minimum length is eight (8) characters1 (95 possible characters).
The probability that a random attempt will succeed or a false
acceptance will occur is 1/(958) which is less than 1/1,000,000.  The
probability of successfully authenticating to the module within one
minute is 10/(958), which is less than 1/100,000.  The ﬁrewall’s
conﬁguration supports at most ten failed attempts to authenticate in a
one-minute period.

Certiﬁcate/Public key-based
The security modules support public-key based authentication using
RSA 2048 and certiﬁcate-based authentication using RSA 2048, RSA
3072, RSA 4096, ECDSA P-256, P-384, or P-521.

The minimum equivalent strength supported is 112 bits.  The
probability that a random attempt will succeed is 1/(2112) which is less
than 1/1,000,000.  The probability of successfully authenticating to
the module within a one minute period is 3,600,000/(2112), which is
less than 1/100,000.  The ﬁrewall supports at most 60,000 new
sessions per second to authenticate in a one-minute period.

The pre-shared key authentication method has a minimum security
strength of 2112.  The probability of successfully authenticating to the
module is 1/(2112), which is less than 1/1,000,000.  The number of
authentication attempts is limited by the number of new connections
per second supported (120,000) on the fastest platform of the Palo
Alto Networks ﬁrewalls.  The probability of successfully
authenticating to the module within a one minute period is
7,200,000/(2112), which is less than 1/100,000.

The security modules support public-key based authentication using
RSA 2048 and certiﬁcate-based authentication using RSA 2048, RSA
3072, RSA 4096, ECDSA P-256, P-384, or P-521.

1 In FIPS-CC Mode, the module checks and enforces the minimum password length of eight (8) as speciﬁed in SP 800-63B.
Passwords are securely stored hashed with salt value, with very restricted access control, and rate limiting mechanism for
authentication attempts.

Page 23

The minimum equivalent strength supported is 112 bits.  The
probability that a random attempt will succeed is 1/(2112) which is less
than 1/1,000,000.  The probability of successfully authenticating to
the module within a one minute period is 3,600,000/(2112), which is
less than 1/100,000.  The ﬁrewall supports at most 60,000 new
sessions per second to authenticate in a one-minute period.

CSP Access Rights
The table below deﬁnes the relationship between access to CSPs and the different module services. The modes of
access shown in the table are deﬁned as:

G = Generate: The module generates or derives the SSP.

R = Read: The SSP is read from the module (e.g. the SSP is output).

W = Write: The SSP is updated, imported, or written to the module.

E = Execute: The module uses the SSP in performing a cryptographic operation.

Z = Zeroise: The module zeroises the SSP.

5. Software/Firmware Security
The module performs the Firmware Integrity test by using HMAC-SHA-256 and ECDSA signature veriﬁcation (HMAC and
ECDSA Cert. #A2906) during the Pre-Operational Self-Test.  In addition, the module also conducts the ﬁrmware load test by
using RSA 2048 with SHA-256 (Cert. #A2906) for the new validated ﬁrmware to be uploaded into the module.

The pre-operational self-tests can be initiated by power cycling the module.  When this is performed, the module
automatically runs the cryptographic algorithm self-tests in addition to the pre-operational ﬁrmware integrity test.

6. Operational Environment
The FIPS 140-3 Operational Environment requirements are not applicable because the Firewalls do not contain modiﬁable
operational environments. The operational environment is limited since the modules include a ﬁrmware load service to
support necessary updates. New ﬁrmware versions within the scope of this validation must be validated through the FIPS
140-3 CMVP.  Any other ﬁrmware loaded into these modules is out of the scope of this validation and requires a separate
FIPS 140-3 validation.

7. Physical Security
The multi-chip standalone modules are production quality containing standard passivation. Chip components are protected
by an opaque enclosure. There are tamper evident seals that are applied on the modules by the Crypto-Ofﬁcer. All unused
seals are to be controlled by the Crypto-Ofﬁcer. The seals prevent removal of the opaque enclosure without evidence. The
Crypto-Ofﬁcer must ensure that the module surface is clean and dry. Tamper evident seals must be pressed ﬁrmly onto the
adhering surfaces during installation and once applied the Crypto- Ofﬁcer shall permit 24 hours of cure time for all
tamper-evident seals. The Crypto-Ofﬁcer should inspect the seals and shields for evidence of tamper every 30 days. If the
seals show evidence of tamper, the Crypto-Ofﬁcer should assume that the modules have been compromised and contact
Customer Support.

Note: For ordering information, see Table 2 for physical kit part numbers and versions.  Opacity shields and Tamper Seals are
included for the physical kits.

Page 28

Refer to the Appendix for instructions on installation of the tamper seals and opacity shields.

11. Life-Cycle Assurance
The module does not have any speciﬁc maintenance requirements.  For details regarding the secure installation, initialization,
startup, and operation of the module, see section “Modes of Operation”.

Palo Alto Network provides an Administrator Guide for additional information noted in the “Reference Documents” section
of this Security Policy.

The module design corresponds to the module security rules. This section documents the security rules enforced by the
cryptographic module to implement the security requirements of this FIPS 140-3 Level 2 module.

1.  The cryptographic module provides four distinct operator roles. These are the User role, Remote Access

VPN role, Site-to-site VPN role, and the Cryptographic Ofﬁcer role.
2.  The cryptographic module provides identity-based authentication.
3.  The cryptographic module clears previous authentications on each power cycle.
4.  When the module has not been placed in a valid role, the operator does not have access to any cryptographic

services.

5.  Data output is inhibited during power-up self-tests, zeroization and error states.
6.  Status information does not contain CSPs or sensitive data that if misused could lead to a compromise of the

module.

7.  There are no restrictions on which keys or CSPs are zeroized by the zeroization service.
8.  The module maintains separation between concurrent operators.
9.  The module does not support a maintenance interface or role.
10.  The module does not have any external input/output devices used for entry/output of data.
11.  The module does not enter or output plaintext CSPs.
12.  The module does not output intermediate key generation values.

Vendor imposed security rules
In FIPS-CC mode, the following rules shall apply:

1.  The operator shall not enable TLSv1.0 or use RSA for key wrapping; it is disabled by default

a.  Checked via CLI using “show shared” command

2.  The operator should not enable TLSv1.3, it is disabled by default.

a.  Checked via CLI using “show proﬁles” command

3.

If using RADIUS, it must be conﬁgured using TLS.

a.  Checked via CLI using “show shared” command

4.

If using TACACS+, conﬁgure the service route via an IPSec tunnel, and ensure the TACACS+ server is conﬁgured for
a minimum password length of eight (8) characters or greater.
a.  Checked via CLI using “show deviceconﬁg” command

Failure to follow these Security Rules will cause the module to operate in a non-compliant state.
