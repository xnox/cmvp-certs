1.  General

1.1.  Scope

This  document  is  a  non-proprietary  Security  Policy  for  Samsung  NVMe  TCG  Opal  SSC  SEDs  PM1743/PM1745  Series,
hereinafter referred to as a “cryptographic module” or “module”. The SSD (Solid State Drive) satisfies all applicable FIPS
140-3  security  level  2  of  ‘Hardware  Module’  requirements,  supporting  TCG  Opal  SSC  based  SED  (Self-Encrypting  Drive)
features. It is designed to protect unauthorized access to the user data stored in its NAND Flash memories. The built-in AES
hardware engines in the cryptographic module’s controller provide on-the-fly encryption and decryption of the user data
without  performance loss.  The SED’s nature also provides instantaneous sanitization of the user data  via  cryptographic
erase.

Table 7. Roles, Service Commands, Input and Output

4.2.  Authentication

The module supports role-based authentication that necessitates verification for assuming the authorization of each role.
The authentication mechanism allows a minimum 8-byte length or longer (up to 32-byte) password, with each byte ranging
from 0x00 to 0xFF, applicable to every Cryptographic Officer and User role supported by the module. This implies that a
single random attempt can succeed with a probability of 1/264 or lower. Each password authentication attempt takes at
least 750 ms. The maximum number of attempts possible in a one-minute period is 80 (60000 ms/750 ms). The Password is
considered a Memorized Secret Authenticator Type as per SP 800-140E/SP 800-63B.

The module claims compliance with IG 4.1.A by implementing a Lock-based authentication model for the "IO command"
service. This protects data-at-rest. The "Lock/Unlock an LBA Range" service enables or disables the "IO command" service.
Power cycling the module completely disables the "IO command" service if it was enabled. Afterward, the service reverts to
its original state, requiring authentication and being enabled/disabled by the "Lock/Unlock an LBA Range" service.

4.3.  Service

The  cryptographic  module  only  supports  the  following  approved  services  and  does  not  support  any  non-approved
services. The abbreviations of the type of access to keys and SSPs have the following interpretation:

•

•

E = Execute: The module performs approved security functions with the SSPs.

G = Generate: The module generates or derives the SSP.

•  W = Write: The SSP is updated, imported, or written to the volatile storage specified in Table 12.

•

Z = Zeroise: The module zeroises the SSP.

6.  Operational Environment

-

-

The cryptographic module operates in a limited operational environment, consisting of the module’s firmware because
this  module  does  not  have  any  operating  system  but  designed  in  a  manner  to  allow  controlled  validated  firmware
modification by an authenticated limited operator. This limited operational setting does not require any specific security
rules, settings/configurations, or restrictions to be set.

The cryptographic module does not provide any general-purpose operating system to the operator.

-  Unauthorized modification of the firmware is prevented by the pre-operational firmware integrity test and conditional

firmware load test.

7.  Physical Security

The following physical security mechanisms are implemented in a cryptographic module:

•

•

•

The module consists of production-grade components enclosed in an aluminum alloy enclosure, which is opaque
within the visible spectrum. The top panel of the enclosure can be removed by unscrewing screws. However, the
module is sealed with tamper-evident labels in accordance with FIPS 140-3 Level 2 Physical Security requirements so
that tampering is easily detected when the top and bottom cases are detached.
Two tamper-evident labels are initially applied over the top case of the module during factory production. Once
applied, these labels cannot be removed and reapplied without evidence of tampering.
The tamper-evident label is applied by Samsung at Manufacturing.

The following table summarizes the actions required by the CO Role to ensure that physical security is maintained:

Temporary SSPs stored in RAM are zeroised during power on reset.

The zeroisation is performed by overwriting the target SSP with a random value generated through the DRBG.

The module does not export SSPs.

All SSPs in volatile memory, including HW SFR, are automatically zeroised instantly either after key generation/use or
upon performing power-on-reset, depending on the characteristics of volatile memory.

This module does not support SSP establishment.

10. Self-Tests

While executing the following self-tests, all data output is inhibited until the completion of the self-test. The operator can
initiate  pre-operational  tests  on-demand  by  power-cycling  the  module.  Conditional  self-tests  are  conducted  before  the
initial operation of approved algorithms. If a cryptographic module fails a self-test, it will enter an error state, during which
all data output is inhibited.

11. Life-Cycle Assurance

Failure to follow the requirements for the Approved Mode of Operation or the rules in Section 11 will result in the module
operating in a non-compliant state, which is out of scope for this validation.

The following specifies the security rules under which the cryptographic module shall operate in accordance with FIPS 140-3:

•
•

The cryptographic module always operates in Approved Mode once the Secure Installation instructions are followed.
The steps required for the secure installation, initialization, and start-up of the cryptographic module, as per FIPS 140-3
VE11.33.01 are as follows:

11.1.  Secure Installation

1.  The user should examine for tamper evidence.

-

Inspect the entire perimeter for cracks, gouges, missing screw(s), and other signs of tampering, including the
tamper-evident sealing label.

If there is any sign of tampering, do not use the product and contact Samsung.

-
Identify the firmware version in the device.

2.

-

Confirm that the firmware version is equivalent to the version(s) listed in this document via NVM express Identify
Controller command.
3.  Take the drive’s ownership.

-

Change SID’s PIN by setting a new PIN.

Activate the Locking SP by using the Activate method.

-
Note: If required to enable the additional Admin authorities in Locking SP, new PINs must be set by the Cryptographic
Officer.

4.  Periodically examine the tamper evidence

-

If there  is any  sign  of tampering, stop using the product to avoid potential security hazards or information
leakage.

11.2.  Operational Description of Module

•

•
•

•
•
•
•
•
•

The  cryptographic  module  maintains  strict  logical  separation  of  data  input,  data  output,  control  input,  control
output, and power.
The cryptographic module does not output CSPs in any form.
The cryptographic module provides the Approved DRBG for generating all cryptographic keys which complies with
Section 6.1 of the SP 800-133r2.
Power cycling the module re-locks the previous unlocked “IO command” service.
The cryptographic module enforces a limited operational environment by the secure firmware load test using ECDSA
with SHA2-384.
The cryptographic module provides a production-grade cryptographic boundary.
The cryptographic module enters the error state upon failure of Self-tests. Most commands except for supported
command from the Host (General Purpose Computer (GPC) outside the cryptographic boundary) are rejected in the
error state and the IO command returns Namespace Not Ready (SC=0x82, SCT=0x0), the other commands return
Internal Error (SC=0x6, SCT=0x0) defined in NVMe specification via the status output. Cryptographic services and
data output are explicitly inhibited when in the error state. When module fails FW Integrity test performed by Mask
ROM, the module will fail to boot; module will not service any requests or provide any status output (module hangs).
The cryptographic module satisfies the requirements of FIPS 140-3 IG C.I (i.e. key_1 ≠ key_2)
The module generates at a minimum 256 bits of entropy for use in key generation.
Bypass capability is not applicable to the cryptographic module
The module generates symmetric keys which are unmodified outputs from the DRBG.
As specified in NIST SP 800-132, keys derived from passwords/passphrases are only used in storage applications.
AES-XTS is only approved for storage applications.
