Panorama VM 10.1 Security Policy    2

1.  General

The Panorama Virtual Appliance 10.1 from Palo Alto Networks Inc., hereafter referred to as “Panorama VM” or the
“cryptographic module” are multi-chip standalone cryptographic modules designed to fulﬁll FIPS 140-3 level 1 requirements.
The Panorama VM provides a centralized monitoring and management of multiple Palo Alto Networks next-generation (NG)
ﬁrewalls and Wildﬁre appliances.

For purposes of this validation, the exact software version of the module tested was 10.1.5. The cryptographic module meets
the overall requirements applicable to Level 1 security of FIPS 140-3.

Type selected for operation system)

Operator Porting Rules
The CMVP allows user porting of a validated software module to an operational environment which was not included as part
of the validation testing.  An operator may install and run this module on any general purpose computer (GPC) or platform
using the speciﬁed hypervisor and operating system on the validation certiﬁcate or other compatible operating and/or
hypervisor system and afﬁrm the module's continued FIPS 140-3 validation compliance.

The CMVP makes no statement as to the correct operation of the module or the security strengths of the generated keys
when ported and executed in an operational environment not listed on the validation certiﬁcate.

Approved Mode of Operation
The following procedure will initialize the modules into the Approved mode of operation:

●  During initial boot up, break the boot sequence via the console port connection (by pressing the maint button when

instructed to do so) to access the main menu.

●  Select “Continue.”
●  Select the “Set FIPS-CC Mode” option to initialize the Approved mode.
●  Select “Enable FIPS-CC Mode”.
●  When prompted, select “Reboot” and the module will re-initialize and continue into the Approved mode of operation

(FIPS-CC mode).

●  The module will reboot.
●
●  Once the module has ﬁnished booting, the Crypto Ofﬁcer can authenticate using the default credentials that come

In “FIPS-CC” mode, the console port is available only as a status output port.

with the module

o  Once authenticated, the module will automatically require the operator to change their password; and the

default credential is overwritten

The module will automatically indicate the Approved mode of operation in the following manner:

●  Status output interface will indicate “**** FIPS-CC MODE ENABLED ****” via the CLI session.
●  Status output interface will indicate “FIPS-CC mode enabled successfully” via the console port.
●  The module will display “FIPS-CC” at all times in the status bar at the bottom of the web interface.
●  The module will display “ﬁps-cc” when “show system info” is entered via the CLI

Should one or more power-up self-tests fail, the Approved mode of operation will not be achieved.  Feedback will consist of:

●  The module will output “FIPS-CC failure”
●  The module will reboot and enter a state in which the reason for the reboot can be determined.
●  To determine which self-test caused the system to reboot into the error state, connect the console cable and follow

the on-screen instructions to view the self-test output.

Note: Disabling “FIPS-CC” mode causes a complete factory reset, which is described in the Zeroization section below.

Non-Compliant State

Failure to follow the directions in the Approved Mode of Operation above or rules noted in Section 11 will result in the
module operating in a non-compliant state, which is considered out of scope of this validation.

Selecting Panorama, Management-Only, and Log Collector System Modes
The Panorama VM supports multiple conﬁgurations that provide varying services. The Cryptographic Ofﬁcer can initialize
the module into different System Mode. The module supports the following System Modes:

●  Panorama
●  Management-Only
●  Log Collector

The default and primary mode of operation is Panorama mode.  An additional mode, Log Collector mode, focuses primarily on
log gathering instead of management.  The ﬁnal mode supported by the module is Management-Only, which focuses
primarily on management functions without logging capabilities.
To convert the module from the default mode, Panorama mode, to Log Collector or Management-Only mode, follow the steps
below:

Convert the Panorama VM from Panorama mode to Log Collector or Management-Only mode:

●  Log into the CLI via SSH, CO is authenticated with username/password
●  Enter “request system system-mode logger” or “request system system-mode management-only”
●  Enter “Y” to conﬁrm the change to the selected mode.
●  The system will reboot and perform the required power on self-tests.

Convert the Panorama VM from Log Collector or Management-Only mode to Panorama mode:

●  Log into the CLI via SSH, CO is authenticated with username/password
●  Enter “request system system-mode panorama”
●  Enter “Y” to conﬁrm the change to the selected mode.
●  The system will reboot and perform the required power on self-tests

Note: Changing the System Mode does not change FIPS-CC Mode.

Zeroization
The following procedure will zeroize the module:

●  Access the module’s CLI via SSH, and command the module to enter maintenance mode (“debug system

maintenance-mode”); the module will reboot

o  Note: Establish a serial connection to the console port

●  After reboot, select “Continue.”
●  Select “Factory Reset”
●  The module will perform a zeroization, and provide the following message once complete:

o

“Factory Reset Status: Success”

Note: Following the completion of this procedure, the module will be placed back into an uninitialized state.

Approved and Allowed Algorithms
The cryptographic modules support the following Approved algorithms.  Only the algorithms, modes, and key sizes speciﬁed
in this table are used by the module.  The CAVP certiﬁcate may contain more tested options than listed in this table.

DRBG

** The module is compliant to IG C.H: GCM is used in the context of TLS and SSH:

●  For TLS, The GCM implementation meets Scenario 1 of IG C.H: it is used in a manner compliant with SP
800-52 and in accordance with Section 4 of RFC 5288 for TLS key establishment, and ensures when the
nonce_explicit part of the IV exhausts all possible values for a given session key, that a new TLS
handshake is initiated per sections 7.4.1.1 and 7.4.1.2 of RFC 5246. During operational testing, the
module was tested against an independent version of TLS and found to behave correctly.

o  From this RFC 5288, the GCM cipher suites in use are
TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256,
TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384,
TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256, and
TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384

●  For SSH, the module meets Scenario 1 of IG C.H.   The module conforms to RFCs 4252, 4253, and 5647.
The ﬁxed ﬁeld is 32 bits in length and is derived using the SSH KDF; this ensures the ﬁxed ﬁeld is unique
for any given GCM session. The invocation ﬁeld is 64 bits in length and is incremented for each invocation
of GCM; this prevents the IV from repeating until the entire invocation ﬁeld space of 264 is exhausted,
which can take hundreds of years. (in FIPS-CC Mode, SSH rekey is automatically conﬁgured at 1 GB of
data or 1 hour, whichever comes ﬁrst)

In all the above cases, the nonce explicit is always generated deterministically. Also, AES GCM keys are zeroized
when the module is power-cycled. For each new TLS or SSH session, a new AES GCM key is established.

The module is compliant to IG C.F:
The module utilizes approved modulus sizes 2048, 3072, and 4096 bits for RSA signatures. This functionality has
been CAVP tested as noted above. The minimum number of Miller Rabin tests for each modulus size is implemented
according to Table C.2 of FIPS 186-4. For modulus size 4096 the module implements the largest number of
Miller-Rabin tests shown in Table C.2. RSA SigVer is CAVP tested for all three supported modulus sizes as noted
above. The module does not perform FIPS 186-2 SigVer. All supported modulus sizes are CAVP testable and tested
as noted above. The module does not implement RSA key transport in the approved mode.

The module does not have any algorithms that fall under:

-  Non-Approved Algorithms Allowed in the Approved Mode of Operation
-  Non-Approved Algorithms Not Allowed in the Approved Mode of Operation

The cryptographic module supports the following non-Approved algorithms that are allowed for use in the Approved mode
of operation:

Cryptographic Boundary
The Panorama Virtual Appliance is a software cryptographic module and requires an underlying general purpose computer
(GPC) environment.  The module consists of a GPC (multi-chip standalone embodiment) with the cryptographic boundary
deﬁned below.  The cryptographic boundary (CB) includes all of the software components of the module, which is included in
the ﬁle name in Section 11 (Panorama_pc-10.1.5) and also the conﬁguration ﬁle that resides on the virtual machine’s virtual
disk.  The physical perimeter (PP) is deﬁned by the enclosure around the host GPC on which it runs. Figure 1 depicts the
boundary and illustrates the hardware components of a GPC.

3.  Cryptographic Module Interfaces
The Panorama VM is designed to operate on a general-purpose computer (GPC) platform.  The module supports the
following FIPS 140-3 interfaces, which have physical and logical ports consistent with a GPC operating environment.   The

Assumption of Roles
The module supports distinct operator roles. The cryptographic module in Panorama or Management-Only mode enforces
the separation of roles using unique authentication credentials associated with operator accounts. The Log Collector mode
only supports one role, the Crypto-Ofﬁcer (CO) role.

The module does not provide a maintenance role or bypass capability.

1/1,000,000.  The probability of successfully authenticating to
the module within one minute is 10/(958), which is less than
1/100,000.  The module’s conﬁguration supports at most ten
failed attempts to authenticate in a one-minute period.

Certiﬁcate/Public key-based
The security modules support public-key based authentication
using RSA 2048 and certiﬁcate-based authentication using RSA
2048, RSA 3072, RSA 4096, ECDSA P-256, P-384, or P-521.

1 In FIPS-CC Mode, the module checks and enforces the minimum password length of eight (8) as speciﬁed in SP 800-63B. Passwords are securely stored
hashed with salt value, with very restricted access control, and rate limiting mechanism for authentication attempts.

Single-Factor Cryptographic
Software (certiﬁcate
common name / public
key-based authentication)

The minimum equivalent strength supported is 112 bits.  The
probability that a random attempt will succeed is 1/(2112) which
is less than 1/1,000,000.  The probability of successfully
authenticating to the module within a one minute period is
10/(2112), which is less than 1/100,000.  The module supports at
most 10 failed attempts and locks out afterwards.

Deﬁnition of CSPs Modes of Access
The following table deﬁnes the relationship between access to CSPs and the different module services.  The modes of access
shown in the table are deﬁned as:

G = Generate: The module generates or derives the SSP.

R = Read: The SSP is read from the module (e.g. the SSP is output).

W = Write: The SSP is updated, imported, or written to the module.

E = Execute: The module uses the SSP in performing a cryptographic operation.

Z = Zeroise: The module zeroises the SSP.

Note: Unless otherwise speciﬁed, all services are available in all system modes.  If there is a service that is speciﬁc to a certain system
mode, it is noted in the Description column.

Software/Firmware Security

5.
The module performs the Software Integrity test by using HMAC-SHA-256 (HMAC Cert. #A2244) during the
Pre-Operational Self-Test.  In addition, the module also conducts a software load test by using RSA 2048 with SHA-256 (Cert.
#A2244) for the new validated software to be uploaded into the module via the Panorama Software Update service. The
Software Integrity Veriﬁcation key and Public key for Software Content Load Test used for the Software Integrity and
Software Load test, respectively, are generated externally and delivered as part of the module software image.

The pre-operational self-tests can be initiated by power cycling the module. When this is performed, the module
automatically runs the cryptographic algorithm self-tests in addition to the pre-operational software integrity test.

Any software loaded into this module that is not shown on the module certiﬁcate is out of scope of this validation, and
requires a separate FIPS 140-3 validation.

6.  Operational Environment

The module is a modiﬁable operational environment as per FIPS 140-3 Level 1 speciﬁcations.  The hypervisor environment
provides an isolated operating environment and is the single operator of the virtual machine.

© 2025      Palo Alto Networks, Inc.

Panorama VM 10.1 Security Policy    17

The tested operating environments isolate virtual systems into separate isolated process spaces.  Each process space is
logically separated from all other processes by the operating environments software and hardware.  The module functions
entirely within the process space of the isolated system as managed by the single operational environment.  This implicitly
meets the FIPS 140-3 requirement that only one (1) entity at a time can use the cryptographic module.

7.  Physical Security
The module is a software only module; FIPS 140-3 physical security requirements are not applicable.

8.  Non-Invasive Security
There are currently no deﬁned Approved non-invasive attack mitigation test metrics in SP 800-140F.

9.
Sensitive Security Parameters Management
The following table details all the sensitive security parameters utilized by the module.

“TLS or SSH Session Key Encrypted” corresponds to the following KTS entries listed in the Approved Algorithms table:

●  AES Cert. #A2244, HMAC Cert. #A2244
●  AES-GCM Cert. #A2244

“SSH, KAS SP 800-56A Rev. 3” corresponds to the following KAS entries listed in the Approved Algorithms table:

●  KAS-ECC-SSC Cert. #A2244, KDF SSH Cert. #A2244
●  KAS-FFC-SSC Cert. #A2244, KDF SSH Cert. #A2244

“TLS, KAS SP 800-56A Rev. 3” corresponds to the following KAS entries listed in the Approved Algorithms table:

Note: SSPs are implicitly zeroized when power is lost, or explicitly zeroized by the zeroize service. In the case of implicit zeroization, the SSPs are
implicitly overwritten with random values due to their ephemeral memory being reset upon power loss. For the zeroization service and zeroization at
session termination, the SSP's memory location is overwritten with random values.

The module utilizes the following entropy source, which is internal to the physical perimeter of the host GPC.

  Table 12 - Non-Deterministic Random Number Generation Specification
Details

Entropy Source

Minimum number of bits of
entropy

Palo Alto Networks DRNG RDSEED
Entropy Source

194 bits

ESV Cert. #E129

The entropy source provides at least 0.506 bits of
entropy per bit of output. The DRBG is seeded
with 384-bits of output from the entropy source.
Therefore the DRBG is seeded with at least 194
bits of entropy before generating keys.

The module generates SSPs (e.g., keys) whose
strengths are modiﬁed by available entropy

10.  Self-Tests

The cryptographic module performs the following tests below. The operator can command the module to perform the
pre-operational and cryptographic algorithm self-tests by cycling power of the module. The pre-operational and conditional
self-tests are performed automatically and do not require any additional operator action.

11.  Life-cycle Assurance
The vendor provided life-cycle assurance documentation describes conﬁguration management, design, ﬁnite state model,
development, testing, delivery & operation, end of life procedures, and guidance.  For details regarding the approved mode of
operation, see “Approved Mode of Operation''.  For details regarding secure installation, initialization, startup, and operation
of the module, see below.

Installation Instructions
The module can be retrieved by downloading Panorama_pc-10.1.5 from the support site:
https://support.paloaltonetworks.com/Support/Index, and a checksum (SHA-256) is available to ensure the module is
correct:

Panorama_pc-10.1.5: 018fd6b322d1d65023751496ac3f9a7c4890fdd523f9d5a9145c752447b492cb

Alternatively, the module version can be obtained by running the following commands via CLI (as an authorized
administrator):

1.  request system software check

2.  request system software download version 10.1.5

3.  request system software install version 10.1.5

4.  request restart system

Palo Alto Network provides an Administrator Guide for additional information noted in the “References” section of this
Security Policy.

The module design corresponds to the module security rules.

Module Enforced Security Rules
When FIPS-CC mode is enabled, the module runs all the required items noted in Section 10 Self-Tests.  This section
documents the security rules enforced by the cryptographic module to implement the security requirements of this FIPS
140-3 Level 1 module.

1.  The cryptographic module shall provide distinct operator roles. When the module has not been placed in a valid

role, the operator shall not have access to any cryptographic services.

2.  The cryptographic module shall clear previous authentications on power cycle.

© 2025      Palo Alto Networks, Inc.

Panorama VM 10.1 Security Policy    23

3.  The module shall support the generation of key material with the approved DRBG.  The entropy provided must

be greater than or equal to the strength of the key being generated.

4.  Data output shall be inhibited during power-up self-tests and error states.
5.  Processes performing key generation and zeroization processes shall be logically isolated from the logical data

output paths.

6.  The module does not output intermediate key generation values.
7.  Status information output from the module shall not contain CSPs or sensitive data that if misused could lead to

a compromise of the module.

8.  There are no restrictions on which keys or CSPs are zeroized by the zeroization service.
9.  The module maintains separation between concurrent operators.
10.  The module does not support a maintenance interface or role.
11.  The module does not have any external input/output devices used for entry/output of data.
12.  The module does not enter or output plaintext CSPs.

Vendor Imposed Security Rules
In FIPS-CC mode, the following rules shall apply:

1.  The operator should not enable TLSv1.0 or use RSA for key wrapping; it is disabled by default.

a.  Checked via CLI using “show shared” command

2.  When FIPS-CC mode is enabled, the operator shall not install plugins.

a.  Checked via CLI using “show plugins installed”

3.  When FIPS-CC mode is enabled, the operator shall not use TACACS+. RADIUS may be used but must be

protected by TLS protocol.

a.  Checked via CLI using “show deviceconﬁg” command

Failure to follow these Security Rules will cause the module to operate in a non-compliant state.

Key to Entity

The cryptographic module associates all keys (secret, private, or public) stored within, entered into or output from the
module with authenticated operators of the module.  Keys stored within the module are only made available to
authenticated operators via TLS or SSH. Keys are only input or output from the module by the authenticated operator via a
SSH or TLS protected communication. Any attempt to intervene in the key to entity relationship would require defeating the
module TLS or SSH encryption and authentication/integrity mechanism.

12.  Mitigation of Other Attacks
This module is not designed to mitigate other attacks outside the scope of FIPS 140-3.
