3  Cryptographic Module Ports and Interfaces
The underlying logical interfaces of the module are the module’s C language Application
Programming Interfaces (APIs). All data input and data output, status ports and control ports are
directed through the interface of the module’s logical component, which are the APIs while the
physical interface is considered the I/O ports of the sub-chip module through which the data input
and data output, status output and control input traverse.

Control inputs which control the operation of the module are
provided through dedicated parameters.

Status output is provided in return codes and through messages.
Documentation for each API lists possible return codes. A
complete list of all return codes returned by the C language APIs
within the module is provided in the header files and the API
documentation. Messages are documented also in the API
documentation.

4  Roles, services, and authentication

The module supports two authorized roles: A Crypto Officer Role and a User Role. No support is
provided for a Maintenance operator. The module does not implement a bypass mode nor
concurrent operators.

When a device is delivered, the Crypto Officer is responsible for initializing the module i.e.,
configure the device by properly setting up key registers for storage of keys/CSPs. The Crypto
Officer is implicitly assumed. The User can perform services from Table 5 and 5a only after the
Crypto Officer takes possession by initializing it, thus creating data to be protected is generated.
The Users of the module are software applications that implicitly assume the User Role when
requesting any cryptographic services provided by the module.

FIPS 140-3 does not require authentication mechanism for level 1 modules. Therefore, the module
does not implement an authentication mechanism.

The module only implements Approved security functions in an Approved mode. The Table 5 below
lists services available. The module provides an approved service indicator by receiving a return
code of “NCL_STATUS_OK to indicate that the service executed an approved security function.

NOTE: The module does not implement any non-Approved Algorithms in the Approved Mode of
Operation (neither with nor without security claim). The module does not implement any non-
approved security functions.

The abbreviations of the access rights to keys and SSPs have the following interpretation:

G = Generate: The module generates or derives the SSP.

R = Read: The SSP is read from the module (e.g., the SSP is output).

W = Write: The SSP is updated, imported, or written to the module.

E = Execute: The module uses the SSP in performing a cryptographic operation.

Z = Zeroise: The module zeroises the SSP.

5  Software/Firmware Security

5.1  Software/Firmware Integrity Technique

The module’s executable code is programmed in a masked ROM which is a type of Read-Only
Memory (ROM) where content is programmed by the integrated circuit manufacturer during the
silicon manufacturing (rather than by the Operator of the module). The memory technology is non
reconfigurable memory as defined in IG 5.A, which will not have any change or degradation of
data for a minimum of 10 years after manufactured date. As such, it is considered a hardware
only module with a non-modifiable operational environment. The requirements of this area are
not applicable to the module.

6  Operational Environment

The HP Endpoint Security Controller Cryptographic Library operates in a non-modifiable
operational environment. The module is programmed by the manufacturer during the silicon
manufacturing (rather than by the user). It maintains its own memory region which can only be
accessed by the module. There is no additional application present within the operating
environment. The module does not spawn any cryptographic processes. The operational
environments in which the module was tested are listed in Table 2.

7  Physical Security

The HP Endpoint Security Controller Cryptographic Library cryptographic module is a Hardware
cryptographic module in a single chip embodiment. More specifically, the module is considered a
sub-chip cryptographic subsystem.

The module consists of production-grade components that include standard passivation
techniques (e.g., a conformal coating applied over the module’s circuitry to protect against
environmental or other physical damage). The module does not implement a maintenance role
and has no maintenance access interface.

9.1  Random Number Generation

The module employs a Hash_DRBG using a SHA-512 PRF. Per section 10.1.1.1 of [SP800-90A], the
internal state of the Hash_DRBG is the V, C, and reseed counter. The Hash_DRBG is seeded by an
ENT(P) which provides 256-bits of entropy to seed and reseed the DRBG during initialization and
reseeding. The estimated amount of entropy per entropy output bit is ~0.6/bit. The DRBG internal
state is not accessible by non-DRBG functions. All random values used by approved security
functions, SSP generation, or SSP establishment method are provided by the Hash_DRBG.

The entropy pool is filled with random bits provided by an
SP800-90B compliant ENT(P) whose noise source is from
Ring Oscillators in hardware TRNG.

Table 7 - Non-Deterministic Random Number Generation Specification

9.2  Key/SSP Generation

The module generates Keys and SSPs in accordance with FIPS 140-3 IG D.H. The cryptographic
module performs Cryptographic Key Generation (CKG) for asymmetric keys as per [SP800-
133rev2] (vendor affirmed), compliant with [FIPS186-4] and using DRBG compliant with [SP800-
90Arev1]. A seed (i.e., the random value) used in asymmetric key generation is obtained from
[SP800-90Arev1] DRBG as described in Section 4 of [SP800-133rev2]. The key generation service
for ECDSA, as well as the [SP 800-90Arev1] DRBG have been ACVT tested with algorithm
certificates found in Table 3.

9.3  Key/SSP Establishment

The module provides the following key/SSP establishment services:

1.  The module implements KAS-ECC-SSC EC Diffie-Hellman Shared Secret Computation

compliant to [SP800-56Arev3] and IG D.F Scenario (2) path (1).
o  The shared secret computation provides between 128 and 256 bits of encryption

strength.

2.  Within the TOEPP, the module offers RSA key wrapping and unwrapping using KTS-OAEP-
basic scheme. The implementation supports 2048 and 3072 modulus size, with both key

encapsulation and un-encapsulation supported. The module does not implement key
confirmation. See section 11.3.2 for operator guidance details.
o  The SSP establishment methodology provides 112 or 128 bits of encryption strength.

9.4  Key/SSP Entry and Output

Keys/SSPs entered or output the module are electronically entered in plaintext form from the
invoking User firmware running on the same device. No Keys/SSPs are entered or output from the
module to outside the TOEPP. According to IG 2.3.B, Transferring SSPs including the entropy input
between a sub-chip cryptographic subsystem and an intervening functional subsystem for Security
Levels 1 and 2 on the same single chip is considered as not having Sensitive Security Parameter
Establishment crossing the HMI of the sub-chip module per IG 9.5.A.

9.5  Key/SSP Storage

The module does not provide persistent storage for keys/SSPs. Keys/SSPs are stored in memory
only and are received for use by the module only at the request of the User firmware.

9.6  Key/SSP Zeroization

Keys and SSPs are explicitly zeroized automatically when structure associated with the cipher is
deallocated or implicitly when the device is powered down thereby rendering the data
irretrievable. Interface with the module is inhibited while zeroization is being performed. For Keys
and SSPs explicitly zeroized automatically the successful completion of a requested service
suffices as the implicit indicator that zeroisation has completed.

10 Self-tests

Self-tests ensure that the module is not corrupted and that the cryptographic algorithms work as
expected. While the module is executing the self-test, no services are not available, and input and
output are inhibited. The module will boot only after successfully passing the HMAC-SHA2-512 and
SHA2-256 CASTs. If an error is detected in any self-test, the module will enter the Error State.

10.1 Pre-Operational Self-Tests

The module is solely implemented in hardware (i.e., only contains executable code that is stored in
non- reconfigurable masked ROM7). As such, the module does not perform any pre-operational
software/firmware integrity test, but instead performs a Cryptographic Algorithm Self-Test on the
HMAC-SHA2-512 and SHA2-256 algorithms when the module is powered on.

The module does not implement a pre-operational bypass test nor pre-operational critical
functions test.

10.2 Conditional Self-Tests

The module performs a conditional self-test when the conditions specified for the following tests occur:

Conditional Cryptographic Algorithm Self-Test

Conditional Pair-Wise Consistency Test

The module does not implement a Software/Firmware Load Test, Manual Entry Test, Conditional Bypass Test
nor Conditional Critical Functions Test.

10.2.1

Conditional Cryptographic Algorithm Self-Tests

The module conducts conditional cryptographic algorithm self-test prior to the first operational use
of each cryptographic algorithm. The table below describe the conditional tests supported by the
module.

Conditional Pair-Wise Consistency Test

The module performs a pair-wise consistency test on when a new ECDSA key pair is generated.
The pair-wise consistency test is performed by calculating a digital signature and then verifying it.
If the signature cannot be verified, the pair-wise consistency test shall fail.

10.2.3

Periodic Self-Test

During runtime, operators can initiate the conditional self-tests on demand by calling
NCL_MISC_SelfTest and passing the algorithm as an argument.

The module’s entropy source is powered on only momentarily to seed the module’s SP800-90B
DRBG. The module performs ENT health tests defined in Section 4 of SP800-90A on the generated
output prior to seeding the SP800-90B DRBG. After completing its execution, the entropy source
powers down.

10.3 Self-Test Error Handling

For any of the conditional self-tests, the module enters an error state upon failing the self-test. A
failure in the conditional CAST or conditional PCT results in “NCL_STATUS_FAIL”. Likewise, a failure
of the ENT health tests will result in an “ENTROPY_SRC_ERROR” status returned to the user. When
in the error state, no cryptographic services are provided, control and data output is prohibited.
The only method to clear this error state is to power cycle the device and then successfully pass
the conditional self-tests.

11 Life-cycle assurance

11.1 Delivery and Operation

As explained in Section 10.1.1, the module is placed in a masked ROM by manufacturer during the
silicon manufacturing. The module is delivered as part of the Nuvoton NPCX998H and Nuvoton
NPCD321H platforms (listed in Table 2). During manufacturing – each chip is tested to make sure
the masked ROM was manufactured correctly; this is done using CRC32 algorithm on the entire
masked ROM code on each device before it is shipped out.

During execution – As part of the device boot process, the code is verified by a dedicated
hardware inside the chip that checks every byte of code compared to a known parity bit. If any
byte fails, the parity test then an internal error is generated; the error is handled by the
application (User) firmware.

11.2 Crypto Officer Guidance

The module is configured to be operational by default. If the device starts up successfully and has
successfully passed the HMAC-SHA2-512 and SHA2-256 CAST, it is operating correctly and can
begin servicing User requests.

11.3 Operator Guidance

11.3.1

End of Life

Once the module reaches its end-of-life stage (End of Life (EOL) date for the HP Endpoint Security
Controller Cryptographic Library is 10 years from manufacturing date) or sanitation is initiated by
the module’s Operator, it is the Operator’s responsibility to clear all existing SSPs from the
module. This can be achieved by either performing a full device reset, or by explicitly invoking the
following sequence of APIs to clear the data from all modules:

•  NCL_SHA_Clear - For each of existing SHA and HMAC contexts
•  NCL_DRBG_Clear - For each of existing DRBG contexts
•  NCL_AES_Clear - For each of existing AES contexts
•  NCL_RSA_Clear - For each of existing RSA contexts
•  NCL_ECC_Clear - For each of existing ECDSA and ECDH contexts

11.3.2

RSA Key Wrapping

To comply with SP800-56Brev2 assurances found in its Section 6 (specifically SP800-56Brev2
Section 6.4 Required Assurances) The entity using the IUT must obtain required assurances listed
in section 6.4 of SP 800-56BRev2 by performing the following steps:

1.  The entity requesting the RSA key unwrapping (un-encapsulation) service from the module,
shall only use an RSA private key that was generated by an active FIPS validated module
that implements FIPS 186-4 compliant RSA key generation service and performs the key
pair validity and the pairwise consistency as stated in section 6.4.1.1 of the SP 800-
56BRev2. Additionally, the entity shall renew these assurances over time by using any
method described in section 6.4.1.5 of the SP 800-56BRev2.

2.  For use of an RSA key wrapping (encapsulation) service in the context of key transport per

IG D.G, the entity using the module, shall verify the validity of the peer's public key using
any method specified in section 6.4.2.1 of the SP 800-56BRev2.
