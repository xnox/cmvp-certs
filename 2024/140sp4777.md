Panorama HW 10.2 Security Policy 2

1. General

The Panorama 10.2 M-200, M-300, M-600 and M-700 from Palo Alto Networks Inc., hereafter referred to as “Panorama
M-Series”, “Panorama HW”, “modules”, or the “cryptographic modules” are multi-chip standalone cryptographic modules
designed to fulﬁll FIPS 140-3 level 2 requirements. Panorama M-Series management appliances provide centralized
management and visibility of Palo Alto Networks next generation ﬁrewalls. From a central location, you can gain insight into
applications, users, and content traversing the ﬁrewalls. The knowledge of what is on the network, in conjunction with safe
application enablement policies, maximizes protection and control while minimizing administrative effort. Your security team
can centrally perform analysis, reporting, and forensics with the aggregated data over time, or on data stored on the local
ﬁrewall.

The Panorama M-Series management appliances’ individual management and logging components can be separated in a
distributed manner to accommodate large volumes of log data. Panorama M-Series management appliances can be deployed
in the following ways:

● Centralized: In this scenario, all Panorama management and logging functions are combined into a single device.
● Distributed: you can separate the management and logging functions across multiple devices, splitting the functions

between managers and log collectors.

o Panorama: The Panorama manager is responsible for handling the tasks associated with policy and device
conﬁguration across all managed devices. The manager analyzes the data stored in managed log collectors
for centralized reporting.

o Management-Only: Providing the ability to perform all functions of Panorama with the exception of logging.
o Log Collector: Organizations with high logging volume and retention requirements can deploy dedicated
Panorama log collector devices that will aggregate log information from multiple managed ﬁrewalls.

● Panorama on the M-600 and M-700 supports an additional mode, the PAN-DB private cloud. The PAN-DB private
cloud is an on-premise solution that is suitable for organizations that prohibit or restrict the use of the PAN-DB
public cloud service. With this on-premise solution, you can deploy one or more M-600/M-700 appliances as
PAN-DB servers within your network or data center.

Approved Mode of Operation
The following procedure will initialize the modules into the Approved mode of operation:

● Install physical kit opacity shields and tamper evidence seals according to the Physical Security Policy section.

physical kits must be correctly installed to operate in the Approved mode of operation. The tamper evidence seals
and opacity shields shall be installed for the module to operate in a Approved mode of operation.

● During initial boot up, break the boot sequence via the console port connection (by pressing the maint button when

instructed to do so) to access the main menu.

● Select “Continue.”
● Select the “Set FIPS-CC Mode” option to initialize the Approved mode.
● Select “Enable FIPS-CC Mode”.
● When prompted, select “Reboot” and the module will re-initialize and continue into the Approved mode of operation

(FIPS-CC mode).

● The module will reboot.
● In FIPS-CC mode, the console port is available only as a status output port.
● Once the module has ﬁnished booting, the Crypto Ofﬁcer can authenticate using the default credentials that come

with the module

o Once authenticated, the module will automatically require the operator to change their password; and the

default credential is overwritten

The module will automatically indicate the Approved mode of operation in the following manner:

● Status output interface will indicate “**** FIPS-CC MODE ENABLED ****” via the CLI session.
● Status output interface will indicate “FIPS-CC mode enabled successfully” via the console port.
● The module will display “FIPS-CC” at all times in the status bar at the bottom of the web interface.
● The module will display “ﬁps-cc” when “show system info” is entered via the CLI

Should one or more power-up self-tests fail, the Approved mode of operation will not be achieved.  Feedback will consist of:

Panorama HW 10.2 Security Policy 5

● The module will output “FIPS-CC failure”
● The module will reboot and enter a state in which the reason for the reboot can be determined.
● To determine which self-test caused the system to reboot into the error state, connect the console cable and follow

the on-screen instructions to view the self-test output.

Note: Disabling FIPS-CC mode causes a complete factory reset, which is described in the Zeroization section below.

Selecting Panorama, Management-Only, Log Collector, and PAN-DB System Modes
Panorama M-Series appliances support multiple conﬁgurations that provide varying services. The Cryptographic Ofﬁcer can
initialize the module into different system modes. The primary and default system mode is the Panorama mode. The
Management-Only system mode is the same as Panorama mode except there is no log collecting service. The Log Collector
system mode is a secondary mode that provides a focused log collecting and forwarding capability. Directions to convert the
appliance into the Log Collector mode are discussed below. The M-600 and M-700 provide a fourth system mode, PAN-DB
Private Cloud server.

Convert the M-200/M-300/M-600/M-700 appliance from Panorama mode to the Management-Only mode:

● Log into the CLI via SSH
● Enter “request system system-mode management-only”
● Enter “Y” to conﬁrm the change to Management-Only mode.
● The system will reboot and perform the required power on self-tests.

Convert the M-200/M-300/M-600/M-700 appliance from Management-Only mode to the Panorama mode:

● Log into the CLI via SSH
● Enter “request system system-mode panorama”
● Enter “Y” to conﬁrm the change to Panorama mode.
● The system will reboot and perform the required power on self-tests.

Convert the M-200/M-300/M-600/M-700 appliance from Panorama mode to the dedicated Panorama Log Collector mode:

● Log into the CLI via SSH
● Enter “request system system-mode logger”
● Enter “Y” to conﬁrm the change to Panorama Log Collector mode.
● The system will reboot and perform the required power on self-tests.

Convert the M-200/M-300/M-600/M-700 appliance from Panorama Log Collector mode to the Panorama mode:

● Log into the CLI via SSH
● Enter “request system system-mode panorama”
● Enter “Y” to conﬁrm the change to Panorama mode.
● The system will reboot and perform the required power on self-tests.

Convert the M-600/M-700 appliance from Panorama Manager mode to the dedicated PAN-DB Private Cloud mode:

● Log into the CLI via SSH
● Enter “request system system-mode panurldb”
● Enter “Y” to conﬁrm the change to PAN-DB Private Cloud mode.
● The system will reboot and perform the required power on self-tests.

Panorama HW 10.2 Security Policy 6

Convert the M-600/M-700 appliance from PAN-DB mode to the Panorama Manager mode:

● Log into the CLI via SSH
● Enter “request system system-mode panorama”
● Enter “Y” to conﬁrm the change to Panorama mode.
● The system will reboot and perform the required power on self-tests.

NOTE: Changing the System Mode does not change the FIPS-CC Mode.

Non-Compliant State

Failure to follow the directions in the Approved Mode of Operation above or rules noted in Section 11 will result in the
module operating in a non-compliant state, which is considered out of scope of this validation.

Zeroization
The following procedure will zeroize the module and must be performed under the control of the operator:

● Access the module’s CLI via SSH, and command the module to enter maintenance mode (“debug system

maintenance-mode”); the module will reboot

o Note: Establish a serial connection to the console port

● After reboot, select “Continue.”
● Select “Factory Reset”
● The module will perform a zeroization, and provide the following message once complete:

o “Factory Reset Status: Success”

Key Generation

Note: Seeds used for asymmetric key
pair generation are produced using the
unmodiﬁed/direct output of the DRBG

The module is compliant to IG C.H: GCM is used in the context of TLS and SSH:

● For TLS, The GCM implementation meets Scenario 1 of IG C.H: it is used in a manner compliant with SP
800-52 and in accordance with Section 4 of RFC 5288 for TLS key establishment, and ensures when the
nonce_explicit part of the IV exhausts all possible values for a given session key, that a new TLS
handshake is initiated per sections 7.4.1.1 and 7.4.1.2 of RFC 5246. During operational testing, the
module was tested against an independent version of TLS and found to behave correctly.

o From this RFC 5288, the GCM cipher suites in use are:
TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256,
TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384,
TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256, and
TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384

● For SSH, the module meets Scenario 1 of IG C.H. The module conforms to RFCs 4252, 4253, and 5647.
The ﬁxed ﬁeld is 4-byte in length and is derived using the SSH KDF; this ensures the ﬁxed ﬁeld is unique
for any given GCM session. The invocation ﬁeld is 8-byte in length and is incremented for each invocation
of GCM; this prevents the IV from repeating until the entire invocation ﬁeld space of 264 is exhausted,
which can take hundreds of years. (In FIPS-CC Mode, SSH rekey is automatically conﬁgured at 1 GB of
data or 1 hour, whichever comes ﬁrst.)

In all the above cases, the nonce_explicit is always generated deterministically. AES GCM keys are zeroized when the
module is power cycled. For each new TLS or SSH session, a new AES GCM key is established.

The module is compliant to IG C.F:

The module utilizes Approved modulus sizes 2048, 3072, and 4096 bits for RSA signatures. This functionality has been CAVP
tested as noted above. The minimum number of Miller Rabin tests for each modulus size is implemented according to Table
C.2 of FIPS 186-4. For modulus size 4096, the module implements the largest number of Miller-Rabin tests shown in Table
C.2. RSA SigVer is CAVP tested for all three supported modulus sizes as noted above. The module does not perform FIPS
186-2 SigVer. All supported modulus sizes are CAVP testable and tested as noted above. The module does not implement
RSA key transport in the approved mode.

The module does not have any algorithms that fall under:

- Non-Approved Algorithms Allowed in the Approved Mode of Operation
- Non-Approved Algorithms Allowed in the Approved Mode of Operation with No Security Claimed
- Non-Approved Algorithms Not Allowed in the Approved Mode of Operation

4. Roles, Services, and Authentication

Assumption of Roles
The module supports distinct operator roles. The cryptographic module in Panorama mode, Management-Only mode, or
PAN-DB mode enforces the separation of roles using unique authentication credentials associated with operator accounts.
The Log Collector mode only supports one role, the Crypto-Ofﬁcer (CO) role.

The module supports concurrent operators.

The module does not provide a maintenance role or bypass capability.

Authentication Strength

Password-based
Minimum length is eight1 (8) characters (95 possible characters).
The probability that a random attempt will succeed or a false
acceptance will occur is 1/(958) which is less than 1/1,000,000.
The probability of successfully authenticating to the module
within one minute is 10/(958), which is less than 1/100,000.  The
module’s conﬁguration supports at most ten failed attempts to
authenticate in a one-minute period.

1 In FIPS-CC Mode, the module checks and enforces the minimum password length of eight (8) as speciﬁed in SP 800-63B.
Passwords are securely stored hashed with salt value, with very restricted access control, and rate limiting mechanism for
authentication attempts.

Certiﬁcate/Public key-based
The security modules support public-key based authentication
using RSA 2048 and certiﬁcate-based authentication using RSA
2048, RSA 3072, RSA 4096, ECDSA P-256, P-384, or P-521.

The minimum equivalent strength supported is 112 bits.  The
probability that a random attempt will succeed is 1/(2112) which is
less than 1/1,000,000.  The probability of successfully
authenticating to the module within a one minute period is
10/(2112), which is less than 1/100,000.  The module in FIPS-CC
mode allows at most 10 failed attempts before a lockout occurs.

Access Control Policy
While in the Approved mode of operation all authenticated services and CSPs are accessed via authenticated SSH or TLS
sessions. Access is restricted to authenticated operators only and no interface is provided to modify the public or private key.

SNMPv3 authentication is supported but is not a method of module administration and does not allow read/write access of
CSPs. Approved and allowed algorithms, relevant CSP and public keys related to these protocols are used to access the
following services. CSP access by services is further described in the following tables. Additional service information and
administrator guidance for Panorama can be found at https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/.

The Crypto-Ofﬁcer may access all services, and through the “management of administrative access” service may deﬁne
multiple Crypto-Ofﬁcer roles with limited services. The User role provides read-only access to the System Audit service.
When conﬁgured in the default mode, Panorama Manager provides services via web-browser based interface and a
command line interface (CLI). For the Panorama Log Collector mode and PAN-DB mode, only the CLI is available for
management.

Panorama HW 10.2 Security Policy 15

SSP Access Rights
The table below deﬁnes the relationship between access to CSPs and the different module services. The modes of
access shown in the table are deﬁned as:

G = Generate: The module generates or derives the SSP.

R = Read: The SSP is read from the module (e.g. the SSP is output).

W = Write: The SSP is updated, imported, or written to the module.

E = Execute: The module uses the SSP in performing a cryptographic operation.

Z = Zeroise: The module zeroises the SSP.

5. Software/Firmware Security

The module performs the Firmware Integrity test by using HMAC-SHA-256 and ECDSA signature veriﬁcation (HMAC and
ECDSA Cert. #A2906) during the Pre-Operational Self-Test. In addition, the module also conducts the ﬁrmware load test by
using RSA 2048 with SHA-256 (Cert. #A2906) for the new validated ﬁrmware to be uploaded into the module.

The pre-operational self-tests can be initiated by power cycling the module. When this is performed, the module
automatically runs the cryptographic algorithm self-tests in addition to the pre-operational ﬁrmware integrity test.

6. Operational Environment

The FIPS 140-3 Area 5 Operational Environment requirements are not applicable because the module contains a
non-modiﬁable operational environment. The operational environment is limited since the module includes a ﬁrmware load
service to support necessary updates. New ﬁrmware versions within the scope of this validation must be validated through
the FIPS 140-3 CMVP. Any other ﬁrmware loaded into this module is out of the scope of this validation and requires a
separate FIPS 140-3 validation.

7. Physical Security

Physical Security Mechanisms
The multi-chip standalone modules are production quality containing standard passivation. Chip components are protected
by an opaque enclosure. There are tamper-evident seals that are applied on the modules by the Crypto-Ofﬁcer. There are
ﬁfteen (15) for the M-200, ﬁfteen (15) for the M-300, twenty-one (21) for the M-600, and twenty-one (21) for the M-700. All
unused seals are to be controlled by the Crypto-Ofﬁcer. The seals prevent removal of the opaque enclosure without
evidence. The Crypto-Ofﬁcer must ensure that the module surface is clean and dry. Tamper evident seals must be pressed
ﬁrmly onto the adhering surfaces during installation and once applied, the Crypto-Ofﬁcer shall permit 24 hours of cure time
for all tamper evident seals. The seals prevent removal of the opaque enclosure without evidence. The Crypto-Ofﬁcer should
inspect the seals and shields for evidence of tamper every 30 days. If the seals show evidence of tamper, the Crypto-Ofﬁcer
should assume that the modules have been compromised and contact support.

Note: For ordering information, see Table 2 for physical kit part numbers and versions. Opacity shields are included in the
physical kits.

11. Life-cycle Assurance

The vendor provided life-cycle assurance documentation that describes conﬁguration management, design, ﬁnite state
model, development, testing, delivery + operation, end of life procedures, and guidance. For details regarding the secure
installation, initialization, startup, and operation of the module, see section “Modes of Operation”.

Palo Alto Network provides an Administrator Guide for additional information noted in the “References” section of this
Security Policy.

Module Enforced Security Rules
The module design corresponds to the module security rules. This section documents the security rules enforced by the
cryptographic module to implement the security requirements of this FIPS 140-3 Level 2 module.

1. The cryptographic module shall provide distinct operator roles. When the module has not been placed in a valid

role, the operator shall not have access to any cryptographic services.

2. The cryptographic module shall provide identity-based authentication.
3. The cryptographic module shall clear previous authentications on power cycle.
4. The module shall support the generation of key material with the approved DRBG. The entropy provided must

be greater than or equal to the strength of the key being generated.

1. Data output shall be inhibited during power-up self-tests and error states.
2. Processes performing key generation and zeroization processes shall be logically isolated from the logical data

output paths.

3. The module does not output intermediate key generation values.
4. Status information output from the module shall not contain CSPs or sensitive data that if misused could lead to

a compromise of the module.

5. There are no restrictions on which keys or CSPs are zeroized by the zeroization service.
6. The module maintains separation between concurrent operators.
7. The module does not support a maintenance interface or role.
8. The module does not have any external input/output devices used for entry/output of data.
9. The module does not enter or output plaintext CSPs.

© 2024 Palo Alto Networks, Inc.

Panorama HW 10.2 Security Policy 44

Vendor imposed security rules

In FIPS-CC mode, the following rules shall apply:

1. When FIPS-CC mode is enabled, the operator shall not install plugins.

a. Checked via CLI using “show plugins installed”

2. When FIPS-CC mode is enabled, the operator shall not use TACACS+. RADIUS may be used but must be

protected by TLS protocol.

a. Checked via CLI using “show deviceconﬁg” command

Key to Entity

The cryptographic module associates all keys (secret, private, or public) stored within, entered into or output from the
module with authenticated operators of the module. Keys stored within the module are only made available to
authenticated operators via TLS or SSH. Keys are only input or output from the module by the authenticated operator via a
SSH or TLS protected communication. Any attempt to intervene in the key to entity relationship would require defeating the
module TLS or SSH encryption and authentication/integrity mechanism.

12. Mitigation of Other Attacks
The module is not designed to mitigate any speciﬁc attacks outside the scope of FIPS 140-3. These requirements are not
applicable.
