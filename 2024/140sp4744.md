2  Cryptographic Module Specification
The Cisco Linux Kernel FIPS Object Module (KFOM) Cryptographic Module is a firmware
hybrid cryptographic library in a multi-chip standalone embodiment that allows for Linux kernel
applications to use approved algorithms. It does not implement any security protocols nor create
any cryptographic keys. Instead, it only provides Linux kernel applications access to approved
algorithms.

The module is intended to run on the UCS C220 M5 and MX68W host platforms or any general-
purpose computer, so the physical perimeter of the module is the tested platforms. The
cryptographic module comprises the Cisco Linux Kernel FIPS Object Module (KFOM)
Cryptographic Module (Firmware Version: 1.0) which is a kernel object file
linux_kfom_1_0_0.ko and the processor (Hardware Version: ARMv8 Cortex-A53, Intel Xeon
Gold 6138) (only for algorithm acceleration) which only operates in the approved mode of
operation which is set at manufacture. The module is validated according to FIPS 140-3 at
overall security level 1. Please refer to Table 1 above for the individual areas.

The cryptographic module maintains validation compliance when operating on the operating
system/mode specified in Table 2 above and on the validation certificate as well as for those
specified in Table 3 above (vendor affirmed). For the latter, the CMVP makes no statement as to
the correct operation of the module or the security strengths of the generated keys when ported to
an operational environment which is not listed on the validation certificate.
Cryptographic Boundary
The KFOM cryptographic module (red box) is a non-modifiable, multi-chip standalone firmware
hybrid cryptographic module providing cryptographic support to the Kernel which takes data in
and out from the host application via the API (libkcapi) feeding into the kernel. All processing is
done on the listed processors in Table 2 above. The KFOM performs no communications other
than with the consuming application. The block diagram below shows the Tested Operational
Environment’s Physical Perimeter (TOEPP) being defined as the physical perimeter of the tested
platform enclosure around which everything runs. The cryptographic boundary is the KFOM
(red box) and the processors (ARMv8 Cortex-A53, Intel Xeon Gold 6138) with PAA.

Modes of Operation

By design, the module is only able to support approved mode of operation. Once the module is
configured in the approved mode of operation by following the steps in Section 11 of this
document, the module will be ready for approved mode of operation.  The module doesn’t claim
the implementation of a degraded mode operation.

•  Algorithm Cert. #A1185 was tested for the OE with PAA
•  There are some algorithm modes that were tested but not implemented by the module.
Only the algorithms, modes, and key sizes that are implemented by the module are shown
in this table.
•  Use of external IV with GCM is exclusively permitted for decryption operations or where
the GCM is used to support the protocol specific implementation used to protect
connections to the calling applications. The GCM IV is generated per FIPS 140-3 IG C.H
technique #3. The counter portion of the IV is set by the module within its cryptographic
boundary. When the IV exhausts the maximum number of possible values for a given
session key, the first party, client or server, to encounter this condition will trigger a
handshake to establish a new encryption key. In case the module’s power is lost and then
restored, a new key for use with the AES GCM encryption/decryption shall be
established.

•  The check for Key_1 ≠ Key_2 is done before using the keys in the XTS-AES algorithm
to process data and is in accordance with IG C.I requirements.

5  Software/Firmware Security

Integrity Technique
The Module is provided in the form of binary executable code. To ensure firmware security, the
Module is protected by HMAC-SHA2-512 (HMAC Certs. #A1182 or #A1185) algorithm.  At
Module’s initialization, the integrity of the runtime executable is verified using a HMAC-SHA2-
512 digest which is compared to a value computed at build time. If at the load time the MAC
does not match the stored, known MAC value, the Module would enter an Error state with all
crypto functionality inhibited.

Integrity Test On-Demand
The integrity test is performed as part of the Pre-Operational Self-Tests. It is automatically
executed at power-on. The operator can initiate the integrity test on demand by power cycling the
host platform. The module is a kernel object file linux_kfom_1_0_0.ko

6  Operational Environment
The module is operated in a non-modifiable operational environment per FIPS 140-3 level 1
specifications. The module is installed within the product for use with the kernel, and the linux
kernel cannot be modified. The operating systems and tested platforms can be found in Table 2.
The application that makes calls to the module is the single user of the module, even when the
application is serving multiple clients.  The module’s firmware version running on each tested
platform is 1.0.

7  Physical Security
Per ISO/IEC 19790 and FIPS 140-3 classification, this is a multi-chip standalone cryptographic
module. KFOM 1.0 is a firmware hybrid module and runs on a production grade chassis.

8  Non-Invasive Security
This section is not applicable as the cryptographic module does not implement any non-invasive
attack mitigation techniques.

9  Sensitive Security Parameters Management
The following table summarizes the Sensitive Security Parameters (SSPs) that are used by the
cryptographic services implemented in the module.

Table 8 - SSPs
Even though the module does implement an approved random number generator, it is not used
by the module for the generation of the cryptographic keys. All Cryptographic keys are
externally generated and imported to the working space assigned by the kernel. The module uses
approved DRBG for the generation of random strings and passes them to the calling application
only upon their request. The cryptographic module is passed a pointer to the cryptographic keys
as API parameters, associated by memory location. The application calling the cryptographic
module passes keys in plaintext within the physical perimeter. The module does not perform
storage of keys. All SSPs can be zeroized by power cycling the host.

Module to operation, therefore the minimum number of bits of entropy

operating applicable.
system
The module does not generate any cryptographic keys but the
SP800-90Arev1 DRBGs are used to provide the random strings
requested by the calling application. These random strings are not
used by the module and is passed to the calling application when
requested.
The module users (the external calling applications) shall use
entropy source which meets the security strength required for the
random number generation mechanism as shown in SP 800-
90Arev1 based on Hash DRBG, HMAC DRBG, and Counter
DRBG.

10 Self-Tests
When the Linux kernel is setup properly the self-test solution is that only the kernel module,
which has been signed and verified can load in cryptographic algorithms. Once the KFOM is
loaded, first the self-test for the algorithm used in the firmware integrity test is run and then the
actual firmware integrity test of the module runs for the KFOM, then all the self-tests for the
algorithms are run. If a self-test fails, the result from the Linux Crypto Test Manager is a failure.
This means the algorithm will not have the self-test flag set. The presence of self-test flag allows
the Linux Crypto Framework to utilize the algorithm.
A successful log message is provided by the module after the successful completion of the self-
tests.
If an error occurs to a valid approved algorithm during the self-test, the module enters hard error
state, and the Linux kernel will print an error message to the console and data output from the
data output interface is inhibited. This results in the system shutting down.

Periodic/On-Demand Self-Tests
The module performs on-demand self-tests initiated by the operator, by powering off and
powering the module back on through power cycling the host. The full suite of self-tests is then
executed. The same procedure may be employed by the operator to perform periodic self-tests.
Self-Test Failure Handling
KFOM reaches the critical error state when any self-test fails. This failure results in kernel panic.
Upon test failure, the module will set an internal flag and enter a critical error state, and a
message will be logged to dmesg. In this state, the module will no longer perform cryptographic
services or output data over the data output interface.
To recover, the module must be re-instantiated by the calling application (through power cycling
the host platform). If the pre-operational self-tests complete successfully, then the module can
resume normal operations. If the module continues to experience self-test failures after
reinitializing, then the module will not be able to resume normal operation.

11 Life-Cycle Assurance
Secure Operations
The tested operating systems segregate user processes into separate process spaces. Each process
space is an independent virtual memory area that is logically separated from all other processes
by the operating system firmware and hardware. The module functions entirely within the
process space of the process that invokes it, and thus the module runs on a single user mode of
operation.
The module is copied into the tested operational environments prior to shipping. The operator
needs to load the module per the instructions below, and power cycle the platform. At this point,
the pre-operational tests are run, followed by the conditional cryptographic algorithm self-tests.
Now KFOM will be in approved mode.
KFOM Loading:
insmod linux_kfom_1_0_0.ko config_file=kfom_priorities ko_file=linux_kfom_1_0_0.ko
The operator can verify that the module is in approved mode by executing the “Show Status”
service command. If the module outputs name and version, it can be considered that the module
is running in approved mode.
The guidance document – readme.rtf version 1.0, can be obtained by contacting the vendor using
the contact information (posted on the validation certificate).
12 Mitigation of Other Attacks
The requirements under INCITS+ISO+IEC 19790+2012[2014], section 7.12 “Mitigation of other
attacks”, are not applicable to the module since the module currently doesn’t support any
mitigation of other attacks services.
