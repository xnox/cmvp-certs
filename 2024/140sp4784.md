1.  General
The Wildﬁre 10.2 WF-500 and WF-500-B from Palo Alto Networks Inc., hereafter referred to as “Wildﬁre” or the
“cryptographic module” is a multi-chip standalone cryptographic module designed to fulﬁll FIPS 140-3 level 2 requirements.
The WildFire 10.2 WF-500 and WF-500-B module identiﬁes unknown malware, zero-day exploits, and Advanced Persistent
Threats (APTs) through dynamic analysis, and automatically disseminates protection in near real-time to help security teams
meet the challenge of advanced cyber-attacks.

Unknown ﬁles are analyzed by WildFire (WF) in a scalable sandbox environment where new threats are identiﬁed, and
protections are automatically developed and delivered in the form of an update. The result is a unique, closed loop approach
to controlling cyber threats that begins with positive security controls to reduce the attack surface, inspection of all trafﬁc,
ports, and protocols to block all known threats, and rapid detection of unknown threats by observing their actual behavior.

The cryptographic module meets the overall requirements applicable to Level 2 security of FIPS 140-3.

Approved Mode of Operation
The following section details the procedure necessary to place the module into the Approved mode of operation.

Install module and interface connections in addition to the physical kit.

●
●  The tamper-evident seals and opacity shields must be installed as per Appendix A for the module to operate in

the Approved mode of operation.

●  Apply power to the device.
●  Establish a serial connection to the console port and command the module to enter into maintenance mode.

o  During initial boot up, break the boot sequence via the console port connection (by pressing the maint

button when instructed to do so) to access the main menu.

●  Select “Continue.”
●  Select the “Set FIPS-CC Mode” option to enter the Approved mode.
●  Select “Enable FIPS-CC Mode,” and press enter.
●  When prompted, select “Reboot” and the module will re-initialize and continue into the Approved mode.
●  The module will reboot.
●
●  Once the module has ﬁnished booting, the Crypto Ofﬁcer can authenticate using the default credentials that

In the Approved mode, the console port is available only as a status output port.

come with the module

o  Once authenticated, the module will automatically require the operator to change their password; and

the default credential is overwritten

The module will automatically indicate the Approved mode of operation in the following manner:

●  Status output interface will indicate “**** FIPS-CC MODE ENABLED ****” via the CLI session.
●  Status output interface will indicate “FIPS-CC mode enabled successfully” via the console port.

Should one or more power-up self-tests fail, the module will not enter the Approved mode of operation.  Feedback will
consist of:

●  The module will output “FIPS-CC failure.”
●  The module will reboot and enter a state in which the reason for the reboot can be determined by following the

on-screen instructions.

Note: Disabling “FIPS-CC” mode causes a complete factory reset, which is described in the Zeroization section below.

Policy
Page 3

Non-Compliant State

Failure to follow the directions in the Approved Mode of Operation above and Section 11 will result in the module operating
in a non-compliant state.

Zeroization

To initiate the zeroization service, perform the following steps:

●  Access the module’s CLI via SSH, and command the module to enter maintenance mode; the module will

reboot

o  Note: Establish a serial connection to the console port

●  After reboot, select “Continue.”
●  Select “Factory Reset.”
●  The module will perform a zeroization, and provide the following message once complete:

o  “Factory Reset Status: Success”

Uninitialized State
If the module does not successfully transition into the Approved mode of operation, or zeroization is performed, the module
will be in an uninitialized state.  It is required to initialize the module in order to perform cryptographic functions.

Approved and Allowed Algorithms
The cryptographic modules support the following Approved algorithms.  Only the algorithms, modes, and key sizes speciﬁed
in this table are used by the module.  The CAVP certiﬁcate may contain more tested options than listed in this table.

*The module is compliant to IG C.H: GCM is used in the context of TLS, IPsec/IKEv2, and SSH:

●  For TLS, The GCM implementation meets Scenario 1 of IG C.H: it is used in a manner compliant with SP
800-52 and in accordance with Section 4 of RFC 5288 for TLS key establishment, and ensures when the
nonce_explicit part of the IV exhausts all possible values for a given session key, that a new TLS
handshake is initiated per sections 7.4.1.1 and 7.4.1.2 of RFC 5246. During operational testing, the
module was tested against an independent version of TLS and found to behave correctly.

o  From this RFC 5288, the GCM cipher suites in use are
TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256,
TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384,
TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256, and
TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384.)

●  For IPsec/IKEv2, The GCM implementation meets Scenario 1 of IG C.H: it is used in a manner compliant
with RFCs 4106 and 7296 (RFC 5282 is not applicable, as the module does not use GCM within IKEv2
itself), and ensures when the module exhausts all possible values for a given session key that this triggers
a rekey condition. During operational testing, the module was tested against an independent version of
IPsec with IKEv2 and found to behave correctly.

●  For SSH, the module meets Scenario 1 of IG C.H. The module conforms to RFCs 4252, 4253, and 5647.
The ﬁxed ﬁeld is 4-byte in length and is derived using the SSH KDF; this ensures the ﬁxed ﬁeld is unique
for any given GCM session. The invocation ﬁeld is 8-byte in length and is incremented for each invocation
of GCM; this prevents the IV from repeating until the entire invocation ﬁeld space of 264 is exhausted,
which can take hundreds of years. (In FIPS-CC Mode, SSH rekey is automatically conﬁgured at 1 GB of
data or 1 hour, whichever comes ﬁrst.)

In all the above cases, the nonce_explicit is always generated deterministically. AES GCM keys are zeroized when the
module is power-cycled. For each new TLS or SSH session, a new AES GCM key is established.

The module is compliant to IG C.F:

The module utilizes Approved modulus sizes 2048, 3072, and 4096 bits for RSA signatures. This functionality has been CAVP
tested as noted above. The minimum number of Miller Rabin tests for each modulus size is implemented according to Table
C.2 of FIPS 186-4. For modulus size 4096, the module implements the largest number of Miller-Rabin tests shown in Table
C.2. RSA SigVer is CAVP tested for all three supported modulus sizes as noted above. The module does not perform FIPS
186-2 SigVer. All supported modulus sizes are CAVP testable and tested as noted above. The module does not implement
RSA key transport in the approved mode.

The module does not have any algorithms that fall under:

-  Non-Approved Algorithms Allowed in the Approved Mode of Operation
-  Non-Approved Algorithms Allowed in the Approved Mode of Operation with No Security Claimed
-  Non-Approved Algorithms Not Allowed in the Approved Mode of Operation

Services
When initialized into the Approved mode of operation, all authenticated services are accessed via SSH or TLS sessions.
Approved and allowed algorithms, relevant CSPs and public keys related to these protocols are accessed to support the
following services.  CSP access by services is further described in the following tables.

The Crypto-Ofﬁcer may access all services and has the ability to deﬁne multiple Crypto-Ofﬁcer roles.  The User role provides
read-only access to the system via the System Audit service.  The Peer-to-Peer VPN role consists in managing the
establishment of VPN connections between several WF-500 and WF-500-B modules.

1 In FIPS-CC Mode, the module checks and enforces the minimum password length of eight (8) as speciﬁed in SP 800-63B.
Passwords are securely stored hashed with salt value, with very restricted access control, and rate limiting mechanism for
authentication attempts.

The minimum equivalent strength supported is
112 bits.  The probability that a random attempt
will succeed is 1/(2112) which is less than
1/1,000,000.  The probability of successfully
authenticating to the module within a one
minute period is 6,000/(2112), which is less than
1/100,000.  The module supports at most 100
new sessions per second to authenticate in a
one-minute period.

SSP Access Rights
The table below deﬁnes the relationship between access to SSPs and the different module services. The modes of
access shown in the table are deﬁned as:

G = Generate: The module generates or derives the SSP.

R = Read: The SSP is read from the module (e.g. the SSP is output).

W = Write: The SSP is updated, imported, or written to the module.

E = Execute: The module uses the SSP in performing a cryptographic operation.

Z = Zeroise: The module zeroises the SSP.

Software/Firmware Security

5.
The module performs the Firmware Integrity test by using HMAC-SHA-256 and ECDSA signature veriﬁcation (HMAC and
ECDSA Cert. #A2906) during the Pre-Operational Self-Test.  In addition, the module also conducts the ﬁrmware load test by
using RSA 2048 with SHA-256 (Cert. #A2906) for the new validated ﬁrmware to be uploaded into the module.

The pre-operational self-tests can be initiated by power cycling the module.  When this is performed, the module
automatically runs the cryptographic algorithm self-tests in addition to the pre-operational ﬁrmware integrity test.

6.  Operational Environment
The FIPS 140-3 Operational Environment requirements are not applicable because the module does not contain a modiﬁable
operational environment. The operational environment is limited since the module includes a ﬁrmware load service to
support necessary updates. New ﬁrmware versions within the scope of this validation must be validated through the FIPS
140-3 CMVP.  Any other ﬁrmware loaded into the module is out of the scope of this validation and requires a separate FIPS
140-3 validation.

7.  Physical Security
Physical Security Mechanisms
The multi-chip standalone module is production quality and contains standard passivation. Chip components are protected
by an opaque enclosure. There are tamper-evident seals that are applied on the module by the Crypto-Ofﬁcer, and any
unused seals are to be controlled by the Crypto-Ofﬁcer.  The Crypto-Ofﬁcer must ensure that the module surface is clean
and dry before applying the seals. The seals prevent removal of the opaque enclosure without evidence, which should be
inspected by the Crypto-Ofﬁcer every 30 days for evidence of tampering. If the seals or opacity shields show evidence of
tamper, the Crypto-Ofﬁcer should assume that the module has been compromised and contact Customer Support.

Note:  For ordering information, see Table 2 for physical kit part numbers and version. Opacity shields are included in the
physical kits.

Operator Required Actions
The following table provides information regarding the various physical security mechanisms, and their recommended
frequency of inspection/test.

of Inspection/Test

Inspection/Test Guidance Details

Table 9 - Physical Security Inspection Guidelines

Tamper-Evident Seals

30 days

Front and Rear Opacity Shields

Verify integrity of tamper-evident seals in
the locations speciﬁed in the appendix.

Verify that the front and rear opacity shields
have not been deformed from their original
shape, thereby reducing their effectiveness.

Verify that the vent overlays have not been
removed or deformed. All edges should
maintain strong adhesion characteristics.

Refer to the following sections for instructions on installation and placement of the tamper seals and opacity shields.
Tamper-evident seals must be pressed ﬁrmly onto the adhering surfaces during installation, and once applied, the
Crypto-Ofﬁcer shall permit 24 hours of cure time for all tamper-evident seals.

WF-500 Tamper Seal Installation (12 Seals)
1. Remove the two pull handles and front modules on the left and right side of the appliance by removing the three (3) screws
located behind each handle/module.  There is no need to disconnect the LED circuit board attached to the end of the ribbon
cable.  Retain these screws for Step 2.

4.

Install a tamper-evident seal on the back of the appliance. This is seal #13 in the WF-500-B Figure 19. You need
to install this seal before you install the WF-500-B physical kit back cover.

5.  Attach the physical kit back cover to the back of the appliance.

a.  Slide the back cover onto the back of the appliance and turn the two (2) thumb screws clockwise

until tight (one (1) screw on each side) to secure the cover.

6.  Apply a tamper-evident seal to each location shown in the following WF-500-B illustrations below.

Also install the overlay stickers to cover vent openings (two (2) stickers on each side). You then install
tamper-evident seals over the overlay stickers. Apply two (2) tamper-evident seals on the back side of the right
rack handle (see seals #18 and #19 on the left side in Figure 19). Apply two (2) tamper-evident seals on the
power supplies (see seals #11 and #12 with rear inset of Figure 19).

Before you apply the tamper-evident seals, ensure that the appliance and physical kit surfaces are
clean and dry. Firmly press one (1) seal on each of the locations shown in the illustrations. Avoid
touching the seals for at least 24 hours to allow time for the seals to properly adhere to the
appliance and physical kit surfaces.

ESV Cert. #E64

Entropy source provides full entropy, which is
provided in the 384-bit seed.

ESV Cert. #E130

The entropy source provides at least 0.506 bits of
entropy per bit of output. The DRBG is seeded
with 384 bits of output from the entropy source.
Therefore the DRBG is seeded with at least 194
bits of entropy before generating keys.

11. Life Cycle Assurance
The vendor provided life-cycle assurance documentation that describes conﬁguration management, design, ﬁnite state
model, development, testing, delivery + operation, end of life procedures, and guidance.  For details regarding the secure
installation, initialization, startup, and operation of the module, see section “Approved Mode of Operation” in Section 2.

Palo Alto Network provides an Administrator Guide for additional information noted in the “References” section of this
Security Policy

Vendor imposed security rules
In FIPS-CC mode, the following rules shall apply:

1.  The operator shall not enable TLSv1.0 or use RSA for key wrapping; it is disabled by default

A.  Checked via CLI using “show shared” command

2.

If using RADIUS, it must be conﬁgured using TLS 1.2.

A.  Checked via CLI using “show shared” command

12. Mitigation of Other Attacks
The module is not designed to mitigate any speciﬁc attacks outside the scope of FIPS 140-3.  These requirements are not
applicable.
