Thales Alenia Space Cryptographic Module for Microsemi RTG4 FPGA
Non-proprietary FIPS 140-3 Security Policy

1  GENERAL

The purpose of this document is to define the non-proprietary FIPS 140-3 Security Policy of the Thales
Alenia Space Cryptographic Module for Microsemi RTG4 FPGA 01.00.00 (Module Version 46.04.00) which
will also be referred to as “TASE-CM-VIPER” throughout this document.

This Security Policy specifies the security rules under which the cryptographic module should operate to
meet FIPS 140-3 Security Level 1 requirements.

1.1  OVERVIEW

This  cryptographic  module  has  been  developed  by  Thales  Alenia  Space  and  it  has  been  implemented
within the Ground Cryptographic Processor (GCP) placed on Earth and within the Volatiles Investigating
Polar Exploration Rover (VIPER) transponder unit. The aim of this cryptographic module is to enable NASA
to encrypt communications at the GCP, and decrypt and authenticate them at the transponder unit using
AES-GCM.  It  is  able  to  encrypt/decrypt  and  authenticate  messages  from  128  bytes  to  1024  bytes  of
information in 128-bit blocks.

Although the TASE-CM-VIPER is the same for the GCP and for the VIPER transponder and can encrypt and
decrypt indistinctly, in a real use case, the information will be encrypted in the GCP which will transmit it
to the VIPER transponder where it will be decrypted and authenticated. The following image shows the
communication process between the GCP and the VIPER transponder:

CRYPTOGRAPHIC MODULE SPECIFICATION

The  TASE-CM-VIPER  is  a  hardware  module  based  on  a  Microsemi  RTG4  FPGA  which  implements  two
Helion  IP  cores  for  supporting  AES-GCM  encryption/decryption  within  the  environment  of  the  VIPER
mission. This cryptographic module is classified by FIPS 140-3 as multiple-chip embedded.

In  addition,  the  cryptographic  module  includes  the  telecommand  (TC)  and  telemetry  request  (TMR)
libraries necessary to control and monitor the cryptographic operations and communications between
the GCP and the VIPER transponder.

2.1  MODULE DESCRIPTION AND CRYPTOGRAPHIC BOUNDARY

The TASE-CM-VIPER is composed of an FPGA which provides all the necessary to operate and interconnect
the Helion IP cores (AES-GCM IP cores) to perform cryptographic operations, and the EEPROM memory
to store all the AES-GCM keys and their CRCs.

The model of each component is specified in the table below:

Figure 3: Cryptographic Boundary of TASE-CM-VIPER depicts the cryptographic module block diagram
specifying the cryptographic boundary for the TASE-CM-VIPER, showing all the input/output interfaces
and the information flow described below:

-

-

-

-

-

-

-

-

The plaintext is entered through the data input interface (PDI) into the TASE-CM-VIPER and it is
ciphered by the Helion IP core before being output from the module through the data output
interface (CDO).

The ciphertext is entered into the TASE-CM-VIPER through the data input interfaces (CDI) and it
is  deciphered  by  the  Helion  IP  core  before  being  output  from  the  module  through  the  data
output interface (PDO).

All  AES-GCM  keys  are  entered  into  the  TASE-CM-VIPER  through  the  data  input  interface
KEYUART by the Crypto Officer and, once the module calculates their CRCs and verifies that they
match  with  the  received  CRCs  through  the  same  interface,  both  the  keys  and  their  CRCs  are
stored into the EEPROM memory.

All the TCs and TMRs are entered into the TASE-CM-VIPER through the control input interfaces
HKUART and KEYUART. Because for the encryption and decryption processes, the TCs associated
with  each  operation  (plaintext  or  ciphertext)  are  loaded  through  the  PDI  and  CDI  interfaces,
these  are  also  considered  as  control  input  interfaces.  In  addition,  the  cryptographic  module
implements a Reset pin used to perform the module reset operation, also considered as a control
input interface.

Because  communication  is  established  between  the  GCP  and  the  VIPER  transponder  and
ciphertext TCs are exchanged between both modules, the interface CDO is considered as control
output interface.

All the status output information related to the state of the cryptographic module is output from
the TASE-CM-VIPER through the HKUART interface. The status output information related to the
verification  of  each  key  CRC  is  output  through  the  KEYUART  interface.  Moreover,  the
cryptographic  module  implements  three  indicators  (Approved  Service  Indicator,  Self-Test
Indicator  and  Zeroization  Indicator)  to  indicate  the  use  of  an  approved  security  service,  the
successful completion of the self-test and zeroization services respectively, also considered as
status output.

Because the TASE-CM-VIPER requires power from the external power supply to the cryptographic
boundary, it implements the power input interface.

The  frames  are  received  through  the  CDI  interface  by  the  FPGA  modulated,  encoded  and
randomized by the RF system. The green block named “Other logic” is in charge of demodulating,
decoding  and  derandomizing  these  input  frames  through  the  ADC  interface  to  feed  the
cryptographic module through the CDI logical interface, which is used to enter the ciphertext to
be deciphered into the TASE-CM-VIPER and consists of a data signal, a valid data signal and a
frame completion signal that indicates when the complete frame has been finished. It is located
into the same FPGA for power consumption purpose and all the functionality implemented by
this  block  is  operational  with  and  without  the  cryptographic  module.  The  information  (green
arrow) between this block and the UART I/F is because the HKUART interfaces allow configuring
this block by using some TCs not related to the cryptographic operation of the module.

2.2  MODES OF OPERATION AND SECURITY FUNCTIONS

The TASE-CM-VIPER can only operate in Approved mode. In this mode, the cryptographic module receives
the input plaintext/ciphertext which is processed by the IP core and the resultant ciphertext/plaintext is
output from the module through the data output interfaces.

Therefore,  in  this  configuration,  the  cryptographic  module  supports  the  Approved  security  feature
detailed in the table below:

Non-proprietary FIPS 140-3 Security Policy

The cryptographic module uses a 96-bit external deterministic IV for the AES-GCM operations. The IV
consists of a 32-bit static field which contains a fixed value identifying the cryptographic module and a
64-bit dynamic field containing a deterministic non-repetitive counter. According to the [SP 800-38D]
document, the maximum number of possible values for a given key of the deterministic non-repetitive
counter is 232. When the counter part of the IV exhausts the maximum number of possible values for a
given key, the cryptographic module will render this key unusable and will not accept any more frames
with such key.

The TASE-CM-VIPER is always operating in Approved mode; therefore, it does not support non-Approved
mode nor degraded mode. In addition, it does not support non-Approved security functions nor vendor
affirmed methods.

When the module is performing self-tests or key zeroization processes, or is in an error state, all data
output through the data output interfaces and all control output through the control output interface are
inhibited. The inhibition of the data output and control output interfaces is performed in the source code
by checking when the module enters in one of detailed states. In addition, the TASE-CM-VIPER does not
require a maintenance interface because maintenance role is not supported.

6  OPERATIONAL ENVIRONMENT

The TASE-CM-VIPER is a multiple-chip embedded cryptographic module which encompasses an FPGA and
an  EEPROM  memory  used  to  store  the  AES-GCM  keys  and  their  CRCs.  Its  operational  environment
corresponds  with  the  cryptographic  module  hardware  and  is  classified  as  non-modifiable  operational
environment. Since the cryptographic module is an FPGA that sequentially executes a single process, there
are no concurrent operators.

PHYSICAL SECURITY

The TASE-CM-VIPER consists of production grade components protected by polymer conformal coating
as  a  standard  passivation  technique  and  it  is  classified  by  FIPS  140-3  as  a  multiple-chip  embedded
cryptographic module.

Moreover,  the  physical  security  is  enhanced  because  in  the  case  of  the  module  placed  in  the  VIPER
transponder there is no possibility of having physical access to it. Regarding the GCP module, it is placed
in a secure room in NASA facilities and it is always used and managed under the supervision of the CO.

9.1  RANDOM BIT GENERATOR

The TASE-CM-VIPER does not support random bit generation.

9.2  SECURITY SENSITIVE PARAMETER GENERATION

The TASE-CM-VIPER does not implement SSP generation algorithms.

9.3  SECURITY SENSITIVE PARAMETER ESTABLISHMENT

The TASE-CM-VIPER does not implement SSP establishment algorithms.

9.4  SECURITY SENSITIVE PARAMETER ENTRY AND OUTPUT

All keys used by the TASE-CM-VIPER to perform approved security functions (authenticated encryption
and decryption operations) must be entered into the cryptographic module. The module is able to store
up to 32 AES-GCM keys and their CRCs identifying them using a unique ID from 1 to 32.

In order to perform the secure key entry, the CO is responsible of completing the following steps to comply
with the FIPS 140-3 standard:

1.  Firstly, the cryptographic keys are entered (via USB) into the PC (non-networked) used to load

the keys into the module.

2.  Secondly, the CO must plug the harness to the KEYUART interface prior to powering on the TASE-

CM-VIPER.

3.  Once the harness is connected, the CO must power on the cryptographic module.
4.  After  the  cryptographic  module  is  powered-up  and  the  self-tests  are  passed  completed
successfully, the cryptographic module will detect that the harness is plugged and start with the
key zeroization process.

5.  When the key zeroization is completed, the key uploading process starts and the CO can upload
up  to  32  keys  in  total  by  using  the  scheme  depicted  in  the  image  below  and  the  following
sequence of TC and TMR:

a.  TC “Load New Key” → This TC is used to load the new key into the TASE-CM-VIPER.
b.  Enter the new key generated externally in plaintext form via software using a PC.
c.  TMR “Key-Status” → This TMR is used to check the CRC of the last uploaded key.

Figure 6: Key Uploading Environment

The upper limit is 32 keys, but the Crypto Officer can enter a lower number of keys into the TASE-CM-
VIPER.

Regarding the SSPs output, the cryptographic module does not support SSP output operations, because it
does not allow access to the keys from outside the cryptographic boundary.

9.5  SECURITY SENSITIVE PARAMETER STORAGE

Once the Crypto Officer has completed the key uploading process depicted above, the keys are stored in
the  EEPROM  memory.  Due  to  the  inhospitable  space  conditions,  the  module  has  several  methods  to
ensure the correctness of the stored keys.

On  the  one  hand,  each  key  is  stored  with  its  own  CRC,  which  will  be  used  before  an  authenticated
encryption/decryption process to guarantee the key validity.

On  the  other  hand,  the  key  storage  is  performed  using  the  Triple  Modular  Redundancy  (TMR)
methodology in order to protect the information against Single Event Effects (SEE) that can disrupt the
keys and their CRC content. Therefore, the result is that each ID, key and CRC will be stored three times
in one page of EEPROM memory.

Table 9: Keys Storage in EEPROM memory

When a key stored in the EEPROM is selected, the TASE-CM-VIPER applies majority voting system for each
of its bytes using the three possible stored values. The CRC over this key is calculated and it is compared
with the CRC stored in the EEPROM, applying again the majority voting system.

9.6  SECURITY SENSITIVE PARAMETER ZEROIZATION

The  key  zeroization  process  will  be  performed  automatically  prior  the  key  uploading  process  as  it  is
specified in Section “9.4 Security Sensitive Parameter Entry and Output”. During this process, the TASE-
CM-VIPER will only erase the 32 memory pages where the AES-GCM keys (AES_EDK) and their CRCs are
stored because these are the only memory pages which contain keys and CSPs.

During the key zeroization process, all data output interfaces are inhibited in order to prevent inadvertent
disclosure of sensitive information as the plaintext cryptographic keys or CSPs.

The  cryptographic  module  indicates  the  successful  completion  of  the  zeroization  process  via  the
Zeroization Indicator (Pin 312).

10  SELF-TESTS

10.1  PRE-OPERATIONAL SELF-TEST

Since the cryptographic module does not implement firmware/software component, the bypass capability
nor critical functions, it does not perform pre-operational self-tests. Therefore, the cryptographic module
directly performs the conditional self-tests.

10.2  CONDITIONAL SELF-TEST

The TASE-CM-VIPER is a hardware cryptographic module based on an FPGA and does not contain software
or firmware components as specified in Section “5 Software/Firmware Security”, so it is not necessary to
implement the software/firmware loading test. In addition, the module does not generate cryptographic
keys,  does  not  allow  the  manual  key  entry,  and  does  not  implement  bypass  capability  nor  critical
functions. Therefore, during the conditional self-test the TASE-CM-VIPER only performs the KAT (Known
Answer Test) to verify the correct operation of the AES-GCM, performing the encryption/decryption and
authentication of known information.

In addition, the User can perform an on-demand conditional self-test by resetting the TASE-CM-VIPER.
The KAT applies for the Approved algorithm detailed in the table below:

TASE-CM-VIPER Conditional Algorithm Self-test

Algorithm

Description

AES-GCM

Known Answer Test (KAT). By performing encryption/decryption and authentication.

Table 10: Conditional Algorithm Self-test

The module will be in Operative state once the conditional self-test is passed successfully (status code of
the module is set  to 101)  and if  the harness for key uploading is not plugged. Until this moment, the
outputs are inhibited to prevent inadvertent disclosure of the key components or CSPs, so the module
cannot output any cryptographic data or perform cryptographic operations.

Moreover, if the conditional self-test fails, the module will reach the error state, not allowing to perform
any  cryptographic  operation  and  keeping  all  data  and  control  outputs  inhibited.  After  an  error,  the
cryptographic module resumes normal operation by means of a reset (Pin 305).

11  LIFE-CYCLE ASSURANCE

11.1  CONFIGURATION MANAGEMENT

The configuration management list is composed of configuration item version control, change control,
flaw remediation tracking and source code review, which are managed by Thales Alenia Space in a private
Git repository with write access restricted to authorized developers.

11.2  CONFIGURATION ITEMS IDENTIFICATION METHOD

The  internal  versioning  of  the  VHDL  source  code  is  performed  by  Git  automatically  and  the  assigned
version and revision are used internally to control the code development, so that it must not be confused
with the final released version of the VHDL that is appended manually to the name of the VHDL code file
using the following format “release-XX_YY_ZZ”, where XX is the version number, YY is the revision number
and ZZ is associated with bug fixing.

Regarding each associated module documentation, they are manually versioned by appending the version
and revision on their filename as follow: Document-X.Y. The assigned version number is stated as part of
the file name with the following naming convention:

•  Naming: Name-X.Y, where Name is the unique name of the related document, and X.Y are the

version and revision of the document. Every new document is named with version v1.0.

•  Version Update: When the document is modified and this modification implies major changes,
the ‘X’ number must be changed. However, if changes and modifications imply minor changes,
then the ‘Y’ number must be changed.

The configuration item list can be consulted in [TAS-CIL] document.

11.3  CRYPTO OFFICER AND USER GUIDANCE

11.3.1 OPERATION RULES

When the module is powered on, it is initialized to operate in Approved mode, which is its only mode of
operation, complying with the following rules:

1.  The cryptographic module is initialized in Approved mode of operation automatically after the

self-test are completed successfully.

2.  The replacement or modification of the module by unauthorized users is prohibited.
3.  During the operational lifetime of the module, it will never be shut down.
4.  The cryptographic module does not need to implement pre-operational self-test.
5.  Conditional self-test does not require any operator action to be executed.
6.  Data output interfaces are inhibited during the key entry, conditional self-test, zeroization and

error states.

7.  Any input interface will ignore any incomplete incoming TC or TMR.
8.  Status information does not contain CSPs or sensitive data.
9.  Zeroization  affects  the  32  EEPROM  memory  pages  which  contain  the  possible  32  keys  to  be

stored.

10.  The cryptographic module does not support the maintenance interfaces or role. Moreover, the

cryptographic module does not implement bypass capability.

11.  The  cryptographic  module  does  not  implement  authentication  mechanisms  because  it  is  not

required for Security Level 1.

12.  The cryptographic module does not support manual key entry.
13.  The keys are entered into the TASE-CM-VIPER in plaintext form via software.
14.  The cryptographic module does not output CSPs, secret or private keys from the module.
15.  According to the [SP 800-38D] document, the maximum number of invocations for each key is

232.

16.  There will be a human operator who will reset the IV to the last one used in case the module’s

power is lost and then restored.

17.  All keys are stored into an EEPROM memory with a unique identifier which allow the user  to

operate with them without having access to their content or value.

18.  The Crypto Officer is the one in charge of performing the key zeroization and uploading of the

new keys to be stored into the EEPROM memory.

19.  If the TASE-CM-VIPER is in Error state, it will not be able to perform cryptographic operations. To

resume normal operation mode, the cryptographic module must be reset.

11.3.2 SECURE DISTRIBUTION

The module is shipped only to NASA via certified courier service by Thales Alenia Space, and it is shipped
in Thales boxes with Thales adhesive. Therefore, the recipient will be able to notice if it is tampered.

In addition, it is not possible to modify the module, notwithstanding, once the module is installed, it is
possible to verify that the  module identifier and version are correct as it is detailed in Section “11.3.4
Installation and Initialization Instructions”.

11.3.3 INTEGRITY AND CONFIDENTIALITY ASSURANCE

The  integrity  and  confidentiality  of  the  cryptographic  module  is  assured  by  following  the  secure
distribution methodology specified in the previous section and verifying the module version and identifier
after following the steps to initialize the module in a secure manner as is specified in the section below.

11.3.4 INSTALLATION AND INITIALIZATION INSTRUCTIONS

When  NASA  receives  the  cryptographic  module,  the  Crypto  Officer  will  be  the  one  in  charge  of
interconnecting and anchoring the support in the GCP and the VIPER transponder. Then, the module can
be initiated in a secure manner by following the steps below:

Step 1: Once the TASE-CM-VIPER is installed and interconnected in a secure manner, it does not contain
any  AES-GCM  key  to  operate.  Therefore,  the  first  step  is  to  proceed  with  the  key  entry  into  the
cryptographic module. The  Crypto Officer,  that is responsible for the CSPs and keeping them into the
module, must follow the steps described in Section “9.4 Security Sensitive Parameter Entry and Output”
to insert up to 32 keys into the module and to store them into the EEPROM memory.

Step 2:  After the  keys are entered and stored into the cryptographic  module, the  Crypto Officer must
power off the TASE-CM-VIPER and unplug the harness from the KEYUART port.

Step 3: Finally, it is necessary to verify the correct module version and identifier by using the TMRs “Show
Module Version” and “Show Module Identifier”, detailed in the [TAS-FS] document, after powering on the
module.

11.3.5 SECURE OPERATION

When the module has been configured and the AES-GCM keys stored in a secure manner by the Crypto
Officer, the TASE-CM-VIPER can be powered on to be used by or User role by using the TCs and TMRs
detailed in [TAS-FS] document and the procedures specified in “4 Roles, Services, and Authentication”.

Once  the  self-tests  are  passed  successfully,  the  data  encryption  and  decryption  operations  can  be
performed without additional security measures, because the module is always operating in  Approved
mode. In addition, the module does not return any private secret, key component or CSP through  the
output data interface.
