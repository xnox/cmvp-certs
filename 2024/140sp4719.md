Notes:

●  The module’s AES-GCM implementation conforms to FIPS 140-3 IG C.H scenario #1 following RFC 5288 for TLS.

The module is compatible with TLSv1.2 and provides support for the acceptable GCM cipher suites from SP 800-
52 Rev1, Section 3.3.1. The operations of one of the two parties involved in the TLS key establishment scheme
were performed entirely within the cryptographic boundary of the module being validated.  The counter portion of
the IV is set by the module within its cryptographic boundary.  When the IV exhausts the maximum number of
possible values for a given session key, the first party, client or server, to encounter this condition will trigger a
handshake to establish a new encryption key.  In case the module’s power is lost and then restored, a new key for
use with the AES GCM encryption/decryption shall be established.

●  No parts of the SSH, TLS, SNMP and IPSec/IKE protocols, other than the KDFs, have been tested by the CAVP

and CMVP.

Authentication Strength

The modules support Password based authentication mechanism using the minimum
length is eight (8) characters password (94 possible characters from the keyboard).  The
probability that a random attempt will succeed or a false acceptance will occur is
1/(94^8) which is less than 1/1,000,000.

For multiple attacks during a one-minute period, as the module supports at most 3
failed attempts to authenticate in a one-minute period, the probability of successfully
authenticating to the module within one minute is 3/(94^8), which is less than
1/100,000.  This calculation is based on the assumption that the typical standard
American QWERTY computer keyboard has 10 Integer digits, 52 alphabetic characters,
and 32 special characters providing 94 characters to choose from in total.
The modules support RSA public-key based authentication mechanism using a
minimum of RSA 2048 bits, which provides 112 bits of security strength. The
probability that a random attempt will succeed is 1/(2^112) which is less than
1/1,000,000.

For multiple attacks during a one-minute period, as the module at its highest can
support at most 17,000 new sessions per second to authenticate in a one-minute
period, the probability of successfully authenticating to the module within a one minute
period is 17,000 * 60 = 1,020,000/(2^112), which is less than 1/100,000.
The modules support ECDSA public-key based authentication mechanism using a
minimum of curve P-256, which provides 128 bits of security strength. The probability
that a random attempt will succeed is 1/(2^128) which is less than 1/1,000,000.

For multiple attacks during a one-minute period, as the module at its highest can
support at most 17,000 new sessions per second to authenticate in a one-minute
period, the probability of successfully authenticating to the module within a one minute
period is 17,000 * 60 = 1,020,000/(2^128), which is less than 1/100,000.

Table 21 - Approved Services

G = Generate: The module generates or derives the SSP.

R = Read: The SSP is read from the module (e.g. the SSP is output).

W = Write: The SSP is updated, imported, or written to the module.

E = Execute: The module uses the SSP in performing a cryptographic operation.

Z = Zeroise: The module zeroises the SSP.

Unauthenticated Services
Unauthenticated Users can run the self-test service by power-cycling the module by removing the power and re-applying.

5. Software/Firmware Security
Integrity Techniques
The module performs the Firmware Integrity test by using HMAC-SHA2-256 (HMAC Cert. #A3563) during the Pre-
Operational Self-Test.  A Firmware Integrity Test Key (non-SSP) was preloaded to the module’s binary at the factory and
used for firmware integrity test only at the pre-operational self-test.  At Module’s initialization, the integrity of the runtime
executable is verified using an HMAC-SHA2-256 digest which is compared to a value computed at build time.  If at the
load time the MAC does not match the stored, known MAC value, the module would enter an Error state with all crypto
functionality inhibited.

The module also supports the firmware load test by using RSA 2048 bits with SHA2-256 (RSA Cert. #A3563) for the new
validated firmware to be uploaded into the module.  A Firmware Load Test Key was preloaded to the module’s binary at
the factory and used for firmware load test.  In order to load new firmware, the Crypto Officer must authenticate into the
module before loading any firmware.  This ensures that unauthorized access and use of the module is not performed.  The
module will load the new update upon reboot.  The update attempt will be rejected if the verification fails.

Integrity Test On-Demand
Integrity test is performed as part of the Pre-Operational Self-Tests.  It is automatically executed at power-on.  The
operator can power-cycle or reboot the module to initiate the firmware integrity test on-demand. This automatically
performs the integrity test of all firmware components included within the boundary of the module.

6. Operational Environment
The Operational Environment requirements are not applicable as the module does not contain modifiable operational
environments.  The operational environment is non-modifiable.  New firmware versions within the scope of this validation
must be validated through the FIPS 140-3 CMVP.  Any other firmware loaded into these modules is out of the scope of
this validation and requires a separate FIPS 140-3 validation.

7. Physical Security
The module’s physical security includes tamper evident labels that are utilized to meet FIPS 140-3 Level 2 requirements.

If additional labels are needed, the CO will need to contact Palo Alto Networks.

ION 1200
The following section demonstrates how to apply the tamper evident labels (TELs) to the ION 1200 modules.  The
enclosure of the modules is the same.

The tamper evident labels shall be installed on the security devices containing the module prior to operating in Approved
mode.  TELs shall be applied as depicted in the figures below.  Any unused TELs must be securely stored, accounted for,
and maintained by the Crypto Officer (CO) in a protected location.

Should the CO have to remove, change or replace TELs for any reason, the CO must examine the location from which the
TEL was removed and ensure that no residual debris is still remaining on the chassis or card.  If residual debris remains, the
CO must remove the debris using a damp cloth.

Any deviation of the TELs placement by unauthorized operators such as tearing, misconfiguration, removal, change,
replacement or any other change in the TELs from its original configuration as depicted below shall mean the module is no
longer in Approved mode of operation.  Returning the system back to Approved mode of operation requires the
replacement of the TELs as depicted below and any additional requirement per the site security policy which are out of
scope of this Security Policy.

The ION 1200 requires 3 tamper evident labels while the ION 1200-C-NA/ION 1200-C-ROW/ION 1200-C-5G-WW
require 4 tamper evident labels.  The figures below detail the location of the labels.

Table 33 - Conditional Firmware Load Test (Crypto Library I)

Periodic/On-Demand Self-Test
The module performs on-demand self-tests initiated by the operator, by power cycling the module. The full suite of self-
tests is then executed. The same procedure may be employed by the operator to perform periodic self-tests.

It is recommended that the Crypto Officer perform periodic testing of the module’s on-demand self-tests every 60 days to
ensure all components are functioning correctly.

Error Handling

If any of the above-mentioned self-tests fail, the module reports the cause of the error and enters an error state (there is
only one error state).  In the Error State, no cryptographic services are provided, and data output is prohibited.  The only
method to recover from the error state is to reboot the module and perform the self-tests, including the pre-operational
firmware integrity test and the conditional CASTs.  The module will only enter into the operational state after successfully
passing the pre-operational firmware integrity test and the conditional CASTs.  The table below shows the different causes
that lead to the Error State and the status indicators reported.

11. Life-Cycle Assurance
All ION devices are designed to handle the various stages of a module’s life-cycle.  The sections below highlight the details
for each stage.

Secure Delivery Procedures
The security of the module is maintained during the transfer of these products from production sites to the customer
through the following mechanisms:

●  Email from Palo Alto Networks, Inc. confirming the order and includes tracking number(s).  When the package

arrives at the customer site, the customer checks the tracking number on the package with the tracking number
supplied by Palo Alto Networks, Inc.

●  The customer also checks the integrity of the package by inspecting the integrity of the security tape and the seals
of the package for tampering.  Any damages to the security tape and the seals of the package would require the
customer to contact Palo Alto.

●  The hardware and applicable documentation are delivered in the same package.

Secure Operation
The module meets all the Level 2 requirements for FIPS 140-3.  Follow the secure operations provided below to place the
module in approved mode.  Operating this module without maintaining the following settings will remove the module from
the approved mode of operation.  The module runs firmware version 6.1.2.  This is the only allowable firmware image for
this current approved mode of operation.  The module is initiated into the Approved mode of operation via the following
procedure:

1.  The Crypto Officer must apply tamper evidence labels as described in Section “Physical Security” of this document
2.  Power on the ION Module
3.  Using the Controller, navigate to the device that is to be initiated

a.  Note: The module authenticates the Crypto Officer using default authentication (Root CA), and then

replaces the default information with a specific one from the Controller (CO role)

4.  Click the three bullets next to the device
5.  Select “FIPS”

a.  Click “proceed” to begin initialization procedure
6.  The module will begin initialization that includes the following:
a.  Zeroization of any sensitive information or data
b.  Power cycle of the device followed by running all self-tests

7.  Once initialization is complete, the module provides the following status output:

a.  Device Mode: “fips”
b.  Self-tests: “Power-up self test successful”

Once the module has completed initialization into the Approved mode of operation, the module automatically enforces a
login certificate change for the Crypto Officer.  Any non-Approved configurations/algorithms are rejected automatically by
the module and an error message is output.

End of Life / Sanitization
End of life dates for the modules are announced publicly via Palo Alto Networks’ services website.  Crypto Officers should
follow the procedure below for the secure destruction of their module:

Note: This process will cause the module to no longer function after it has wiped all configurations and keys.

1.  Access the module via SSH with Crypto Officer
2.  Authenticate using proper credentials
3.  Execute command: “disable system”
a.  Confirm command

4.  Module will begin zeroization process and wipe all security parameters and configurations within the module’s

boundary

12. Mitigation of Other Attacks
This module is not designed to mitigate against any other attacks outside of the FIPS 140-3 scope.
