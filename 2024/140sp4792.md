Purpose of the Security Policy

There are three major reasons that a security policy is needed:

•

It is required for FIPS 140-3 validation.

•  To  provide  a  specification  of  the  cryptographic  security  that  will  allow  individuals  and  organizations  to

determine whether a cryptographic module, as implemented, satisfies a stated security policy.

•  To describe to individuals and organizations the capabilities, protection, and access rights provided by the
cryptographic module, thereby allowing an assessment of whether the module will adequately serve the
individual or organizational security requirements.

Target Audience

This document is part of the package of documents that are submitted for FIPS 140-3 conformance validation of
the module. It is intended for the following people:

•  Developers.

•  FIPS 140-3 testing lab.

•  The Cryptographic Module Validation Program (CMVP).

•  Administrators of the cryptographic module.

•  Users of the cryptographic module.

Table 3. Vendor Affirmed Operational Environment

Modes of operation
The module supports both Approved and Non-Approved modes of operation.  The Module will be in approved mode
when all pre-operational self-tests have completed successfully and only approved algorithms/services are invoked.
See Table 4 and Table 9 below for a list of the supported approved/allowed algorithms/services. The non-approved
mode is entered when a non-approved algorithm/non-approved service is invoked.  See Table 6 and Table 10 for
a  list  of  non-approved  algorithms/non-approved  services.  When  the  module  is  initialized,  the  self-tests  are
executed  automatically.  After  successful  completion  of  self-test,  the  module  enters  operational  state.  Module
supports only normal operation.  Degraded operation is not supported.

The following table shows the Approved algorithms that can be used in Approved Mode of Operation:

Please note that due to the lack of the associated self-tests to DSA, KAS-ECC-SSC and KAS-FFC-SSC algorithms,
Table 6 lists those algorithms as the Non-Approved Algorithms Not Allowed in the Approved Mode of Operation.

The  “Non-Approved  Algorithms  Allowed  in  the  Approved  Mode  of  Operation  with  No  Security  Claimed”  table
defined in SP 800-140B is missing because the module does not implement any such algorithms.

The “Non-Approved  Algorithms  Allowed  in  the  Approved Mode  of  Operation”  table  defined  in  SP  800-140B  is
missing because the module does not implement any such algorithms.

Cryptographic boundary

The module is defined as a multi-chip standalone software module, with the boundary of the Tested Operational
Environment’s Physical Perimeter (TOEPP) being defined as the physical perimeter of the tested platform
enclosure around which everything runs.

The physical perimeter is the hardware platform on which the module is installed. The cryptographic boundary of
the module is the SCrypto cryptographic module, a single object module file named fipscanister.o, which is
linked to create the executable files scrypto_v2.7_x64_qsee_release.a for the tested platform running QSEE
5.24, QSEE 6.1 (64-bit) and scrypto_v2.7_x64_teegris500_sys_release.so for the tested platform running
TEEgris 5.0.0 (64-bit).

Figure 1 below illustrates a block diagram of a typical GPC and the module’s physical perimeter.  The module’s
cryptographic boundary consists of all functionalities contained within the module’s compiled source code.

5.  Software/Firmware security

  Integrity technique

The module is provided in the form of binary executable code.  To ensure the software security, the module is
protected by HMAC-SHA2-256 (HMAC Certs. #A3243) algorithm.  The software integrity test key (non-SSP) was
preloaded to the module’s binary at the factory and used for software integrity test only at the pre-operational self-
test.  At module’s initialization, the integrity of the runtime executable is verified using an HMAC-SHA2-256 digest
which is compared to a value computed at build time.  If at the load time the MAC does not match the stored,
known MAC value, the module would enter an Error state with all crypto functionality inhibited.

  On-demand integrity test

Integrity tests are performed as part of the Pre-Operational Self-Tests.  It is automatically executed at power-on.

6.  Operational environment

The module operates in a modifiable operational environment per FIPS 140-3 level 1 specifications.  The module
runs  on  a  commercially  available  general-purpose  operating  system  executing  on  the  hardware  tested  platform
specified in Table 2.

The operating system shall be restricted to  a single operator  mode of  operation  (i.e., concurrent operators are
explicitly excluded).  The external application that makes calls to the cryptographic module is the single user of the
module, even when the application is serving multiple clients.  The operational environment provides the capability
to separate the module during operation from other functions in the operational environment.  Those functions do
not obtain information from the module related to the CSPs and do not modify CSPs, PSPs, or the execution flow
of the module other than via the interfaces provided by the module itself.

Table 12 – Non-Deterministic Random Number Generation Specification

Random number generation

The module employs an Approved SP 800-90Arev1 CTR_DRBG for creation of random numbers.  The module uses the physical entropy source (ESV Certs. #E67,
E152, E221 or E224) from the operational environment as the source of random numbers for DRBG seeds.  The Entropy Source produces the random numbers
from an entropy pool maintained by the underlying Operating System.  The module is a software module that contains an approved DRBG that is seeded exclusively
from one known entropy source located inside the module’s physical perimeter but outside the module’s boundary.  The module provides at least 256 bits of entropy
to instantiate the DRBG.

The module performs the Repetition Count Test (RCT) and Adaptive Proportion Test (APT) as the Health Test to the entropy source that is used to instantiate the
module’s DRBG.

Use of RBG output

The module’s SP800-90Arev1 CTR_DRBG is used to generate random numbers for key generation.

The calling application is responsible for storage of generated keys returned by the module.  It is not possible for the module to output information during the key
generating process.

SSP entry and output

All keys and SSPs that are entered from or output to the module are entered from or output to the invoking application running on the same device.  Keys/SSPs
entered into the module are electronically entered in plain text form.  Keys/SSPs are output from the module in plain text form if required by the calling application.
The module does not support manual key entry or key output.  Keys or other CSPs can only be exchanged between the module and the calling application using
appropriate API calls.  The module does not output intermediate key generation values.

Samsung SCrypto Cryptographic Module

FIPS 140-3 Non-Proprietary Security Policy

The module performs two independent internal actions for the output of plaintext CSPs:

1.  The module calls the random number generator service and verifies that the service has been completed without any errors.

2.  The module performs the Pair-wise Consistency test and verifies that the test is completed without any errors.

Only after the successful completion of these two actions will the module allow the output of plaintext CSPs.

SSP storage

Keys are not stored inside the cryptographic module.  A pointer to a plaintext key is passed through the algorithm APIs.  Intermediate keys stored in the module’s
memory are immediately replaced with 0s in the memory after use.  Keys residing in internally allocated data structures (during the lifetime of an API call) can only
be accessed using the module defined API.  The operating system protects memory and process space from unauthorized access.  Only the calling application that
creates or imports keys can use or export such keys.  All API functions are executed by the invoking calling application in a non-overlapping sequence such that no
two API functions will execute concurrently.

SSP zeroization

The  zeroization  mechanism  for  all  of  the  CSPs  is  to  replace  0s  in  the  memory  which  originally  stored  the  CSPs.  Zeroization  of  sensitive  data  is  performed
automatically by calling zeroization API function OPENSSL_cleanse() for temporarily stored CSPs or cycling the power to the tested platform.  In addition, the module
provides functions to explicitly destroy CSPs related to random number generation services.  The calling application is responsible for parameters passed in and
out of the module.  Input and output interfaces are inhibited while zeroization is performed.

Samsung SCrypto Cryptographic Module

FIPS 140-3 Non-Proprietary Security Policy

10.  Self-tests

The  module  performs  a  series  of  power-up  self-tests,  that  covers  all  of  its  approved  algorithms.  The  module
executes  all  self-tests  when  the  module  is  initialized  during  the  boot  process.  Self-tests  can  also  be  manually
invoked by calling FIPS_SCRYPTO_post(1).  When the module passes all of its power-up Self-tests, the module
sets an internal variable to reflect this.  A calling application can call the FIPS_status() API to obtain the value of
this internal variable (1 if the Self-test was successful, and 0 otherwise if the Self-test failed).  In addition to Known
Answer  Tests  (KATs)  for  each  of  the  module’s  cryptographic  algorithms,  the  module  also  performs  a  binary
integrity test to check for corruption.  If any KAT self-test or the integrity test fails, the module sets its error flag
(static  variable),  returns  an  error  code  to  the  API  function  caller  to  indicate  the  error,  enters  an  error  state
(FIPS_ERR), and inhibits Crypto APIs that return cryptographic information.  While the module is executing the
self-tests, services are not available, and input and output are inhibited.

Pre-operational self-test

The  module  performs  Pre-operational  Self-tests  automatically  when  the  module  is  loaded  into  memory  (i.e.  at
power on). The Pre-operational Self-tests contain pre-operational software integrity test to ensure that the module
is not corrupted. The integrity test is performed on the runtime image of the module using HMAC-SHA2-256. Prior
to  software  integrity  test,  a  CAST  for  HMAC-SHA2-256  is  performed.  If  the  CAST  on  the  HMAC-SHA-256  is
successful, the HMAC value of the runtime image is recalculated and compared with the stored HMAC value pre-
computed at compilation time (for details, see also Section 5). While the module is performing the Pre-operational
Self-tests no other functions are available and all output is inhibited. Once Pre-operational Self-tests are completed
successfully, the module enters operational mode and cryptographic services are available.

Conditional self-tests

Conditional cryptographic algorithm self-tests

The module performs conditional cryptographic algorithm self-tests (CASTs) at module initialization to ensure that
the algorithms work as expected, before any security function or process is invoked via module interface.

The module performs self-tests that cover all Approved cryptographic algorithms supported in the approved mode
of operation using the Known-answer Tests (KAT) as shown in the table below.  None of the keys used for the KAT
are considered as SSP.

Periodic self-tests

The  module  provides  the  service  to  perform  both  Pre-operational  self-test  and  CASTs  on-demand  by  calling
SCRYPTO_post() function.  This service performs all the cryptographic algorithm tests listed in Table 13 and pre-
operational  software  integrity  test.  During  the  execution  of  the  on-demand  self-tests,  no  other  functions  are
available and all output is inhibited.  If any of the tests fail, the module will enter the Error state.

Error state and status indicators

The module has an API indicating the status of the Self-test FIPS_status().  It returns 1 while the modules is in the
operational state otherwise 0 while the modules is in the Error state.  In the Error state, no cryptographic services
are provided, and data output is prohibited.

11.  Life-cycle assurance

Secure installation

The module is built into the operational environment and delivered with a device.  There is no standalone delivery
of the module as a software library.

Secure initialization and startup

The module is initialized during the loading of the module before any cryptographic functionality is available.  The
operating system is responsible for the initialization and loading processes of the module.  The module is designed
with  constructor  (default  entry  point  of  the  module)  which  ensures  that  the  cryptographic  algorithm  self-tests
(CASTs) and pre-operational self-test are initiated automatically when the module is loaded.

Secure operation

The module is provided directly to solution developers and is not available for direct download to the general public.
The module is installed on an operating system specified in Section 2.1.

Additional Rules of Operation:

1.  The  writable  memory  areas  of  the  module  (data  and  stack  segments)  are  accessible  only  by  the
application so that the operating system is in "single user" mode, i.e. only the application has access to
that instance of the module.

2.  The  operating  system  is  responsible  for  multiprocessing  operations  so  that  other  processes  cannot

access the address space of the process containing the module.

3.  Only the services defined in Table 9 shall be used in Approved Mode of operation.

Maintenance requirements

The module does not support maintenance role.

End of life

The module does not provide persistent storage for keys, SSPs, user data, etc.  The module does not store any
sensitive information beyond the lifetime of an API call.  Intermediate CSPs stored in the memory of the module
are immediately replaced with 0s in the memory after use. The end user of the operating system is also responsible
for  zeroizing  SSPs  when  the  cryptographic  module  is  no  longer  deployed  or  intended  for  further  use  by  the
operator.
