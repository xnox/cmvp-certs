Qualcomm® Inline Crypto Engine (UFS)

FIPS 140-3 Non-Proprietary Security Policy

1  General

1.1  This Security Policy Document
This Security Policy describes the features and design of the module named Qualcomm® Inline
Crypto Engine (UFS) using the terminology contained in the FIPS 140-3 specification. The FIPS 140-
3 Security Requirements for Cryptographic Modules specifies the security requirements that will be
satisfied by a cryptographic module utilized within a security system protecting sensitive but
unclassified information. The NIST/CCCS Cryptographic Module Validation Program (CMVP)
validates cryptographic modules to FIPS 140-3. Validated products are accepted by the Federal
agencies of both the USA and Canada for the protection of sensitive or designated information.

This Non-Proprietary Security Policy may be reproduced and distributed, but only whole and intact
and including this notice. Other documentation is proprietary to their authors.

1.2  How this Security Policy was Prepared

In preparing the Security Policy document, the laboratory formatted the vendor-supplied
documentation for consolidation without altering the technical statements therein contained. The
further refining of the Security Policy document was conducted iteratively throughout the
conformance testing, wherein the Security Policy was submitted to the vendor, who would then
edit, modify, and add technical contents. The vendor would also supply additional documentation,
which the laboratory formatted into the existing Security Policy, and resubmitted to the vendor for
their final editing.

This document is the non-proprietary FIPS 140-3 Security Policy for versions 3.2.0, 3.2.1, 4.0.1 and
4.0.2 of the Qualcomm Inline Crypto Engine (UFS). It has a one-to-one mapping to the [SP 800-
140B] starting with section B.2.1 named “General” that maps to section 1 in this document and
ending with section B.2.12 named “Mitigation of other attacks” that maps to section 12 in this
document.

2.3  Mode of Operation of the Module

The Qualcomm Inline Crypto Engine (UFS) supports two modes of operation; (1) the approved
mode in which the approved services are available; and (2) the non-approved mode, in which the
non-approved services are available.

When the Qualcomm Inline Crypto Engine (UFS) starts up successfully, after passing all the self-
tests, the module is operating in the approved mode of operation by default and can only be
transitioned into the non-Approved mode by calling one of the non-Approved services listed in
Table 8. Section 4 provides details on the service indicator implemented by the module. The
service indicator identifies when an approved service is called.

The Qualcomm Inline Crypto Engine (UFS) can be configured to operate in one of the following two
settings where the settings can be changed prior to each service request:

•  Full Disk Encryption (FDE) that performs an encryption of all write operations and a

decryption of all read requests with one key.

•  Per-File Encryption (PFE) that performs an encryption of one write operation and a

decryption of one read operation with a key dedicated to this operation.

The Qualcomm Inline Crypto Engine (UFS) supports a key storage outside of the boundary which
allows up to 64 software selectable key contexts. Each context holds 2 AES keys needed for AES-
XTS. One such context may be used for FDE or otherwise all 64 contexts may be used for PFE.
When an encryption configuration is established, the chosen software selected context key is
referenced and will be used for the operation by the Qualcomm Inline Crypto Engine (UFS).

7  Physical Security

The Qualcomm Inline Crypto Engine (UFS) is a sub-chip enclosed in the platforms that are listed in
Table 2 that are made up of production grade component and conform to the Level 2
requirements for physical security.

At the time of manufacturing, the die is embedded within a printed circuit board (PCB), which
prevents visibility into the internal circuity of the Qualcomm Inline Crypto Engine (UFS). The
layering process which is used to embed the die into the PCB also prevents tampering of the
physical components without leaving tamper evidence.

The Qualcomm Inline Crypto Engine (UFS) is further protected by being enclosed in commercial off
the shelf mobile device utilizing production grade commercially available components and that the
mobile device enclosure that completely surrounds the Qualcomm Inline Crypto Engine (UFS).

There are no steps required to ensure that physical security is maintained.

Table 9 - SSPs

9.2  SSP Generation

The Qualcomm Inline Crypto Engine (UFS) does not provide any SSP generation or SSP
establishment methods.

9.3  SSP Entry and Output

The caller provides the AES keys for encryption and/or decryption. These keys are input to the
module in plaintext form by the entity residing within the same physical perimeter of the SoC on
which the Qualcomm Inline Crypto Engine (UFS) runs. The module does not output any SSPs.

9.4  SSP Storage

The module does not provide persistent storage of SSPs. The SSP i.e., the AES keys are provided
by the caller are set up by the CO and are temporarily stored in hardware registers. Once the keys
are written to the registers, they are not readable from outside the Qualcomm Inline Crypto Engine
(UFS).

9.5  SSP Zeroization

When the Qualcomm Inline Crypto Engine (UFS) performs a module reset, it will zeroize all SSPs
contained within itself. The registers for the SSPs will implicitly be set to zero upon the reset,
indicating the zeroization was successful.

10 Self-tests

10.1 Pre-Operational Tests

Table 10 – Conditional Self-Tests

Test

KAT

KAT

Conditional tests are performed automatically without any operator intervention during power-up
of the Qualcomm Inline Crypto Engine (UFS); these tests ensure that the cryptographic algorithms
work as expected. While the conditional tests are executing, services are not available, and input
and output are inhibited.

10.3 On-demand Self-Test

On demand self-tests can be invoked by powering-off and reloading the module or when a reset
event is received. This test performs the same conditional tests that are performed during power-
up. During the execution of the on-demand self-tests, cryptographic services are not available, and
no data output or input is possible.

10.4 Error States

If any of the conditional self-tests or on-demand test fails, the Qualcomm Inline Crypto Engine
(UFS) will enter the error state. Data output is prohibited, and no further cryptographic operation is
allowed in the error state. This is performed by the control logic that and prevents external usage
when an error is detected.

To recover from the error state, re-initialization is possible by successful execution of the power up
tests, which can be triggered by either a power-off/power-on cycle or the receipt of a reset event.
Once locked, the Qualcomm Inline Crypto Engine (UFS) will only respond to a reset which will
cause it to re-execute the power up tests. If the error persists, the Qualcomm Inline Crypto Engine
(UFS) will remain unavailable.

11 Life-cycle assurance

11.1 Delivery and Operation

The Qualcomm Inline Crypto Engine (UFS) is a sub-chip module that runs on the platforms listed in
Table 2. These SoCs are delivered from the vendor via a trusted delivery courier.
On the reception of the SoC, the operator shall first check all sides of the box to verify that it has
not been tampered during the shipment. Then, after opening the box the operator shall verify that
the moisture barrier bag is still sealed and does not present any trace of tampering. Finally, after
retrieving the SoC, the operator shall perform a visual inspection of the external package of the
module, it should look similar to the pictures in Figure 2 through Figure 13.
If one of these verifications fail, the operator shall contact their Qualcomm representative which
released the delivery before operating the module.
Once the product is received by the customer and powered up the test defined in section 10 will
be executed.

11.2 End of Life

As stated in section 9.4, the module does not perform persistent storage of SSPs. SSP values only
exists in volatile memory and these values are zeroized when the module is reset. The procedure
for secure sanitization of the module at the end of life is simply to power it off, which is the action
of zeroization of the SSPs. As a result of this sanitization via power-off, the SSPs are removed from
the module, so that the module may either be distributed to other operators or disposed.

11.3 Crypto Officer Guidance

There is no specific crypto officer guidance required for the module.

Note: AES XTS

The module does not support AES-XTS with data unit lengths greater than 2^20 AES blocks.

To meet the requirement stated in IG C.I, the module implements a check to ensure that the two
AES keys used in AES XTS mode are not identical.

The XTS mode shall only be used for the cryptographic protection of data on storage devices. It
shall not be used for other purposes, such as the encryption of data in transit.

11.4 Configuration Management

ClearCase, a version control system from IBM/Rational, is used to manage the revision control of
the hardware code (Verilog code) and hardware documentation. The ClearCase version control
system provides version control, workspace management, parallel development support and build
auditing. The Verilog code is maintained within the ClearCase database used by Qualcomm
Technologies, Inc.
