module provides its logical interfaces via Application Programming Interface (API) calls. The logical
interfaces provided by the module are mapped onto the FIPS 140-3 interfaces (data input, data output, control
input, control output and status output) as follows.

Table 4-2 defines the relationship between access to CSPs and the different module services. The modes of
access shown in the table are defined as:
• R = Read: The module reads the CSP. The read access is typically performed before the module uses
the CSP.
• E = Execute: The module executes using the CSP.
6

•  W = Write: The module writes the CSP. The write access is typically performed after a CSP is
imported into the module, when the module generates a CSP, or when the module overwrites an
existing CSP.
•  Z = Zeroize: The module zeroizes the CSP.

5.  Software/Firmware Security
Integrity Techniques
The module is provided in the form of binary executable code. To ensure the firmware security, the module
is protected by HMAC-SHA2-256 (HMAC Certs. #A1639, #A1640, #A6772 or #A6773) algorithm. The
Firmware Integrity Test Key (non-SSP) was pre-loaded to the module’s binary the factory and used for
firmware integrity test only at the pre-operational self-test. At Module’s initialization, the integrity of the
runtime executable is verified using a HMAC-SHA2-256 digest which is compared to a value computed at
build time. If at the load time the MAC does not match the stored, known MAC value, the module would
enter to an Error state with all crypto functionality inhibited. The firmware module was saved in the Flash
memory in the DAL format.
The module also supports the firmware load test by using HMAC-SHA2-256 (HMAC Certs. #A1639,
#A1640, #A6772 or #A6773) algorithm. The Firmware Load Test Key was pre-loaded to the module’s
binary the factory and used for firmware load test. The operator can update the module’s firmware upon
successful verification, the module will load the new update upon reboot. The update attempt will be
rejected if the verification fails.
Integrity Test On-Demand
Integrity test is performed as part of the Pre-Operational Self-Tests. It is automatically executed at power-
on. The operator can power-cycle or reboot the tested platform to initiate the firmware integrity test on-
demand.

6.  Operational Environment
The module is operated in limited operational environment per FIPS 140-3 level 1 specifications. The
operating system is restricted to a single operator mode of operation (i.e., concurrent operators are
explicitly excluded), no other settings or restrictions to the operational environment are required. The
application that makes calls to the modules is the single user of the modules, even when the application is
serving multiple clients.
The module’s firmware version running on each tested platform is detailed below.
•  DAACUS00-002-R00 on Zebra CR6080/CR8178/STB3678
•  DAACWS00-002-R00 on Zebra CS6080/DS8178/DS3678
•  DAAHIS00-002-R00 on Zebra DS8288
•  DAAHGS00-002-R00 on Zebra CR8288

7.  Physical Security
The module is running on the multi-chip standalone production grade platform to meet physical security
requirements from FIPS 140-3 level 1. The module’s Tested Operational Environment’s Physical Perimeter
(TEOPP) is drawn at the casing of the tested platform (Zebra CS6080. Zebra CR6080, Zebra CS8288 or
Zebra CR8288).  The module’s tested platforms consist of production-grade components.  All ICs are coated
with industry standard passivation.
8.  Non-invasive Security
The module does not support Non-invasive Security. Thus, the security requirements from Section Non-
invasive Security in FIPS 140-3 are not applicable.

10. Self-Tests.
When the module is loaded or instantiated (after being powered off, rebooted, etc.), the module runs pre-
operational self-tests. The operating system is responsible for the initialization process and loading of the
library. The module is designed with a default entry point (DEP) which ensures that the self-tests are
initiated automatically when the module is loaded.
Prior to the module providing any data output via the data output interface, the module would perform and
pass the pre-operational self-tests. A firmware integrity test is performed on the runtime image of the
module with HMAC-SHA2-256 algorithm. Prior to the firmware integrity test, the module conducts a
HMAC-SHA2-256 Cryptographic Algorithm Self-test (CAST). If the CAST on the HMAC-SHA2-256 is
successful, the HMAC value of the runtime image is recalculated and compared with the stored HMAC
value pre-computed at compilation time. Following the successful pre-operational self-tests, the module
would execute the Conditional Cryptographic Algorithm Self-tests (CASTs) for all approved cryptographic
algorithms implemented by the module during power-up as well.
10

The self-test success (return code ‘0’) or failure (return code ‘-5’) is output as a return value of the library
load API call, which is functioning as the self-test status indicator. If one of the self-tests fails, the module
transitions into an error state with the return code ‘-5’ output from the module’s status output interface.
While the module is in the error state, all data through the data output interface and all cryptographic
operations are disabled. The error state can only be cleared by reloading the module. All self-tests must be
completed successfully before the module transitions to the operational state.
Below are the details of the self-tests conducted by the module.
❖ Pre-Operational Self-Tests:
• Pre-operational firmware integrity test
o HMAC-SHA2-256 KAT
o Firmware Integrity Test (using HMAC-SHA2-256)
❖ Conditional Self-Tests.
• Conditional cryptographic algorithm tests
o AES-CBC with 256 bits Encryption Know Answer Test (KAT)
o AES-CBC with 256 bits Decryption KAT
o AES-KWP with 256 bits Encryption KAT
o AES-KWP with 256 bits Decryption KAT
o HMAC-SHA2-256 with 256 bits KAT
o SHA2-256 KAT
Please note that the module conducts all CASTs successfully prior to the first operational use of the
cryptographic algorithm.
• Conditional firmware load test
o Firmware Load Test (HMAC-SHA2-256)
11. Life-cycle Assurance
The module always runs in the Approved Mode of Operation and does not implement any Non-Approved
Security Functions. The module design corresponds to the module security rules. This section documents the
security rules enforced by the cryptographic module to implement the security requirements of this FIPS 140-
3 Level 1 module.
General Guidance
1. The validated module’s firmware binary files, DAACUS00-002-R00.dal (on Zebra
CR6080/CR8178/STB3678). DAACWS00-002-R00.dal (on Zebra CS6080/DS8178/DS3678),
DAAHIS00-002-R00.dal (on Zebra DS8288), or DAAHGS00-002-R00.dal (on Zebra CR8288), was
installed into the respective tested platform (Table 2-1) while being manufactured.
2. The module is provided directly to Zebra solution developers and is not available for direct download or
purchase by the general public.
3. To initialize the module, the operator needs to power on the tested platform.
4. The module is operated in a limited Operational Environment and only supports single user operator.
The module provides one operator role: Crypto Officer
11

5. The module does not support concurrent operators.
6. The module does not support a maintenance interface or role.
7. The module does not have any external input/output devices used for entry/output of data.
8. The module does not output the plaintext CSPs.
9. The module does not output intermediate key values.
10. Status information does not contain CSPs or sensitive data that if misused could lead to a compromise
of the module.
11. The Crypto Officer shall load the FIPS 140-3 validated firmware only to maintain validation.
12. Please conduct the periodic self-tests no more than 30 days (i.e., once/month) in order to avoid any
conditions that may result in the interruption of the module’s operations.
12. Mitigation of Other Attacks
The module does not support Mitigation of Other Attacks. Thus, the security requirements from Section
Mitigation of Other Attacks in FIPS 140-3 are not applicable.
