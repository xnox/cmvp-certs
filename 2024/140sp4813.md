2.  Cryptographic Module Specification
This CM provides various cryptographic services using approved algorithms. Services  include
hardware-based data encryption, cryptographic erase, independently protected user data LBA
ranges, and FW Download. The CM always encrypts the user data, protects CSPs from unauthorized
access, and provides secure sanitization methods by supporting TCG Opal SSC features. The
operational rules described in this document adheres to TCG Opal.
This CM is a multiple-chip-embedded hardware cryptographic module. The cryptographic boundary
of the CM is the entire HDD. The physical interface for power-supply and for communication is one
SAS connector. The CM is connected with host system by this SAS connector. The logical interface
is the SAS, TCG SWG and Opal SSC.
The CM has the non-volatile storage area for not only user data but also the keys, CSPs, and FW.
The latter storage area is called the “system area”, which is not logically accessible / addressable by
the host application.
The CM has one approved mode of operation and CM is always in approved mode of operation. The
CM  provides  only  approved  services  defined  in  4.2.  Non-approved  security  functions  are  not
implemented.

2.1  Product Version
The Toshiba Secure TCG Opal SSC SED has been validated in the following versions:

Table 5: Roles, Service Commands, Input and Output

4.2  Services
The CM supports the TCG Single User Mode functionality defined in the Single User Mode feature
set of TCG Opal. A single role (LockingSP.Userx) is assigned to manage the associated range (range
X) during the TCG single user mode. The LockingSP.Reactivate or LockingSP.Activate method
enables this mode. Authorized roles of some services differ when the CM is in single user mode.
About such services, the Role(s) column in Table 6 is divided into two rows. The upper row shows
authorized roles in non-single user mode (normal mode), while the lower row shows authorized roles
against range X in single user mode.
The  CM  provides  the  following  services  to  operators  per  Section  7.4.3.1  of  ISO/IEC
19790_2012_2015:

in Table 6
The modes of access to SSPs shown in Table 6 are defined as:
G = Generate: The module generates or derives the SSP.
R = Read: The SSP is read from the module (e.g. the SSP is output).
W = Write: The SSP is updated, imported, or written to the module.
E = Execute: The module uses the SSP in performing a cryptographic operation.
Z = Zeroise: The module zeroises the SSP.

Table 6: Approved Services

5.  Software/Firmware Security
FW integrity check is performed at power on. Signature verification using RSASSA-PKCS#1-v1_5 of
the FW codes (in the flash ROM and in the disk media) and EDC verification of the FW code in the
Mask ROM are done. The operator can initiate the on-demand FW integrity check by power cycling.
All firmware components are in executable form, which cannot be dynamically modified.

6.  Operational Environment
The CM is a hardware module and operates in a non-modifiable operational environment, that is its
firmware cannot be modified and no code can be added or deleted. SSPs are controlled by the CM
itself, and uncontrolled access to CSPs and uncontrolled modifications of SSPs are prevented.
Although firmware can be updated by “Firmware Download” service, whole FW codes (in the flash
ROM and in the disk media) are replaced by this service, and the module becomes another module

which requires new 140-3 certification.

7.  Physical Security
The CM has the following physical security:
⚫  Production-grade components with standard passivation
⚫  Exterior of the drive is opaque
The operator is required to periodically inspect the enclosure condition of the CM.
8.  Non-Invasive Security
The CM does not employ non-invasive mitigation techniques referenced in NIST SP800-140F.

9.  Sensitive Security Parameters Management
The CM uses SSPs in the following tables:

requirements.
Table 9: Non-Deterministic Random Number Generation Specification

If the source may deteriorate to the point when the generation of the sufficient amount of entropy
can no longer be guaranteed, health test detects the source deterioration, enter an error state, and
halts the CM. When the CM continuously enters in error state in spite of several trials of reboot, the
CM shall be sent back to factory to recover from error state.

enters the Idle state
The  public  verification  key  “PubKey2”  used  in  firmware  integrity  check  resides  within  the
MaskROM code and is not a SSP.
SHA2-256(A1637) is embedded in RSASSA-PKCS#1-v1_5, while SHA2-256(A1638) is used in HMAC,
and SHA2-256(A1645) is employed in Hash DRBG.
The CM does not implement reseed function of Hash DRBG.
Table 10: Self-Tests

If the CM fails the self-test, it enters one of three error states: Error State (Conditional Test), Error
State (FW Load Test), or Boot Error State. If the SP800-90B continuous health test fails, it enters
Error State (Conditional Test); if the firmware load test fails, it goes to Error State (FW Load Test);
and for other self-tests, it transitions to Boot Error State. Status indicator for each error state is
specified in Table 10 (e.g. “Status: CHECK CONDITION(02h), Sense Data: 04 40 91” indicates the
CM is currently in Boot Error State).
When in the error state, the CM does not perform any cryptographic operations or output data. A
power cycle is required to clear the error state. When the CM continuously enters the error state
despite several reboot attempts, the CM should be returned to the factory for recovery from the error
state.
The CM does not support any degraded operation.

11. Life-Cycle Assurance
The following are the secure initialization procedure for the CM.
The CM is always in approved mode of operation in a deployed environment. In addition to this, the
following procedure of initial settings will allow further secure operation during power cycling.
Please refer to TCG Opal specification (TCG Storage Security Subsystem Class: Opal Version 2.01
Revision 1.00) for the details.
(1) Activate LockingSP by “TCG Activate” service.
(2) Set LockOnReset in Download port to “Power Cycle”.
(3) Set ReadLockEnabled and WriteLockEnabled to 1(true) and LockOnReset to “Power Cycle”.
(4) Do a power-on-reset.
The longest service life of the CM under suitable conditions and treatment is 5 years. By the end of
this period the operator is required to follow the CM’s end of life procedures below.
(1) Initialize internal sensitive data in the host system.
(2) Initialize parameters and user information in the CM by “Zeroization (with RKey)” service.
For additional details, refer to the guidance documents provided with the CM:
⚫ 3.5 type SAS Hard Disk Drives Product Specification
⚫ 3.5 type SAS Hard Disk Drives Interface Specification
⚫ 3.5 type Hard Disk Drives SED Specification
⚫ Toshiba SED HDD FIPS140-2/3 Use case Rev.6.0
12. Mitigation of Other Attacks
The CM does not mitigate other attacks beyond the scope of 140-3 requirements.
