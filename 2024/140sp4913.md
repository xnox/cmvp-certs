Introduction
Federal Information Processing Standards Publication 140-3 — Security Requirements for Cryptographic
Modules specifies requirements for cryptographic modules to be deployed in a Sensitive but Unclassified
environment. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and Canadian Centre for Cyber
Security (CCCS) Cryptographic Module Validation Program (CMVP) run the FIPS 140-3 program. The NVLAP
accredits independent testing labs to perform FIPS 140-3 testing; the CMVP validates modules meeting
FIPS 140-3 validation. Validated is the term given to a module that is documented and tested against the
FIPS 140-3 criteria.

More information is available on the CMVP website at:
https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/cryptographic-module-validation-program

 General

Scope

This document describes the cryptographic module non-proprietary security policy for the WaveLogic 5
Extreme  Encryption  Modem  (Hardware  versions:  007,  012 and  014)  (Firmware  Version  12.3)  by  Ciena
Corporation.  It  contains  specification  of  the  security  rules  under  which  the  cryptographic  module
operates, including those derived from the requirements of the FIPS 140-3 standard.

Overview

The WaveLogic 5 Extreme Encryption Modem is an optical transponder daughter card installed within a
Ciena optical transponder service module. It consists of a multiple chip-embedded  application specific
integrated circuit (ASIC) along with optical components and supporting circuitry.

All security-relevant communications to the module via its management interface (Ethernet) are
encrypted using TLS v1.3. The module also supports a client input and output data interface and optical
connector. All traffic entering and exiting the module via the optical connector is encrypted/decrypted
using AES GCM. The module provides fully secure cryptographic functionality, including peer
authentication, key derivation, datapath encryption, physical security, and identification and
authentication of the module’s Crypto Officer (CO). This module is configured and monitored by a Ciena
Control Processor Module.

The module operates in Approved mode by default. No additional configuration is needed for rendering
or operating the module in the Approved mode.

The following table lists the level of validation for each area in FIPS 140-3:

2.  Cryptographic Module Specification

Figure 1: High level module block diagram

As shown in the above block diagram, the module consists of an ARM A53 quad core processor with internal RAM.
The firmware running on the processor performs all the monitoring/control activities related to the datapath
encryption feature.

The crypto accelerator is a security co-processor. It contains hardware cryptographic engines and firmware for the
WaveLogic 5e Encryption Modem Crypto library.

The datapath encryption and decryption block performs the AES-GCM encryption and decryption
function on the client payload data.

The module is packaged within other Ciena products to form a complete encryption transport solution.
The Ciena product forms the Trusted Operational Environment’s Physical Perimeter (TOEPP) for the
module.

Figure 2 below shows the cryptographic boundary of the module (highlighted in red).

Overall security design and the rules of operation

•  No parts of the TLS 1.3 protocol, other than the KDF, have been tested by the CAVP and CMVP

•

per FIPS 140-3 IG D.C.
In accordance with FIPS 140-3 IG D.H, the cryptographic module performs Cryptographic Key
Generation (CKG) as per SP800-133rev2 (vendor affirmed). The resulting symmetric keys and
seed value for asymmetric keys are the unmodified output from the Approved DRBG.

•  The module’s AES-GCM implementation also conforms to IG C.H Scenario #5 following RFC 8446

for TLS v1.3 and provides support for GCM cipher suites from Section 8.4 of RFC 8446. The IV is
generated internally using the module’s Approved DRBG and will only be used in the context of

(Ciena Corporation © 2024)

Version 1.0

the AES-GCM encryption in the context of the TLS v1.3 protocol. The protocol’s implementation
is contained within the boundary of the module under test.

•  The module’s AES-GCM implementation also conforms to IG C.H Scenario #2 and the IV is

generated by the Approved DRBG that is internal to the module’s boundary. The IV length is 96
bits as per SP800-38D.

The initialization requirements for the module can be found in Section 11 Life-cycle Assurance in this
document.

4.  Roles, Services, and Authentication

The module supports one authorized role (i.e., Crypto Officer role). The CO role is responsible for
module initialization and module configuration, including security parameters, key management, status
activities, and audit review.

The CO role is assumed explicitly by the Ciena Control Processor Module that configures and monitors
the module. The Ciena Control Processor Module authenticates to the module using TLS 1.3 certificate-
based authentication.

probability for a random attempt to succeed is:

                      1:2^192 or 1: 6.277 x 10^57

which is less than 1:1,000,000. The fastest

Hence, at most 10 ×10^6 × 60 = 6 × 10^8 =
600,000,000 bits of data can be transmitted in
one minute. Therefore, the probability that a
random attempt will succeed, or a false

In Approved mode, the module provides a limited number of services for which the operator is not
required to assume an authorized role (see Table 7). None of the services listed in the table disclose
cryptographic keys and CSPs or otherwise affect the security of the module.

•  Authentication

The module supports identity-based authentication. Module operators must authenticate to the module
before being allowed access to services that require the assumption of an authorized role. The CO
authenticates to the module from the Control Processor module using the TLS 1.3 protocol. The TLS 1.3
uses an ECDSA (P-521) public key.

The module can be configured to use either a Pre-Shared Key or X.509 Certificate for module peer
authentication. The pre-shared key is a 256-bit key. The X.509 certificate is P-384 or P-521.

Self-initiated Cryptographic Output

The module supports self-initiated cryptographic output functionality via the Datapath Encryption/
Decryption Service. Before enabling this service, the CO must configure and perform two independent
internal actions in order for the service to get activated. The independent internal actions are as follows:

1)  The CO must authenticate with the modem.

2)  The CO must perform the service to activate PSK or install a certificate authentication.

Software/Firmware Security

The module uses ECDSA P-521 using SHA2-512 for firmware integrity testing/verification. The
FIT_PUBLIC, an ECDSA P-521 SHA2-512 Public key, is used to authenticate the Linux kernel. This is run at
startup and on demand by reloading the module. The module also runs the self-tests for ECDSA
Signature verification, SHA2-256 and SHA2-512 prior to running the integrity check. The executable form
of the module firmware is a pre-compiled binary.

6.  Operational Environment

The module is a hardware module with the embodiment type as a multi-chip embedded cryptographic
module. Hence, the module’s operational environment (OE) is a limited OE since the module is designed
to accept only controlled firmware changes that successfully pass the firmware load test.

The requirements per this section do not apply to the module since the module claims to meet Physical
Security Level 2 requirements.

Inspection/Test Guidance
Details

Two tamper-evident seals are
applied to the multi-chip
embedded cryptographic
module during manufacturing;

The physical security of the
module is intact if there is no
evidence of tampering with the
tamper-evident seal(s);

If evidence of tamper is found,
the Cryptographic Officer is
requested to follow their
internal IT policies, which may
include contacting Ciena for
replacing the unit

Table 10 – Physical Security Inspection Guidelines

The module is shipped from the factory with the required physical security mechanisms (tamper-evident
seals, metal covers and PCB layers) installed. The CO must perform a physical inspection of the unit for
signs of damage and to ensure that all physical security mechanisms are in place. Additionally, the CO
should check the package for any irregular tears or openings. If damage is found or tampering is
suspected, the CO should follow internal security policies which include contacting Ciena. The Figure 2 in
Section 2 of this document shows the placement of the tamper seals.

Key Generation and Entropy

The module generates keys as described in SP 800-133rev2 Section 4, Option #1, 5.1, 5.2, 6.2.1 and
6.2.2. It uses an Approved CTR_DRBG (as specified in SP 800-90Arev1) to generate symmetric keys and
seed for asymmetric keys. The DRBG is seeded from seeding material provided by a hardware-based
(Wavelogic 5e Encryption Modem EIP-76 TRNG), which provides an entropy source and unbiased
random sequence of bits to the DRBG.

The module is a hardware module with an entropy generating inside the module’s cryptographic
boundary compliant with Scenario 1 (a) described in FIPS 140-3 IG 9.3.A. The entropy source produces
256-bit output samples with full i.e., 256 bits of entropy.

10.  Self-tests

ISO/IEC 19790 requires the module to perform pre-operational self-tests to ensure the module integrity
and  the  correctness  of  the  cryptographic  functionality  at  start-up.  The  algorithms  supported  by  the
module require cryptographic self-tests and these tests are run when the module is in operational state
prior to the first use of algorithm. Some functions also require conditional tests during normal operation
of the module. The pre-operational firmware integrity test (using ECDSA P-521 SHA2-512) can be run on
demand by reloading the module.

c.  Conditional Firmware Load test: ECDSA P-521 SHA2-512

The CAST for the cryptographic algorithms used to perform the Approved integrity technique, ECDSA P-
521 SHA2-512 KATs, occur before the integrity test.

The module implements the above cryptographic algorithm self-tests which are run prior to the first use
of the algorithm for the cryptographic operations and are also classified as a part of conditional self-tests.

Upon the failure of any pre-operational self-test and the cryptographic algorithm self-tests, the module
goes into “Critical Error” state and disables all access to cryptographic functions and SSPs. A permanent
error status will be relayed via the status output interface, which then raises an alarm and adds an entry
to the system log file. In case of a firmware integrity failure, the module returns “failed loading sn kernel
image” and “Cryptographic Algorithm Self-Test failure” in case of one or more CAST failures.

Upon  failure  of  the  firmware  load  test, the module enters  “Soft  Error”  state.  The  soft  error  state  is a
nonpersistent state wherein the module resolves the error by rejecting the loading of the new firmware.
Upon rejection, the error state is cleared, and the module resumes its services using the previously loaded
firmware.

If the module encounters an error in any other conditional self-tests (Pairwise Consistency tests, noise
source error, etc.) the module will enter a soft error state where the requested command fails. The error
condition may be cleared by re-executing the service which prompted the conditional self-test.

If the error condition is not cleared, then the module is considered to be malfunctioning and should be
returned to Ciena.

11.  Life-Cycle Assurance

The module only runs in an Approved mode of operation. The CO can monitor and configure the module
via the TLS 1.3 management channel from the Ciena Control Processor Module. Detailed instructions for
monitoring and troubleshooting the module are provided in the Ciena’s User’s Guide and Technical
Practices document.

Ciena uses Git software for the management of source code artifacts and SharePoint for hardware and
documentation version control. The module is developed using high level programming languages C and
C++.

The module is always delivered via commercial bounded carrier.

The shipment will contain a packing slip with the serial numbers of all shipped devices. Prior to
deployment the receiver shall verify that the hardware serial numbers match the serial numbers listed in
the packing slip. The module is shipped from the factory with the required physical security mechanisms
(tamper-evident labels, metal covers and PCB layers) installed. The CO must perform a physical
inspection of the unit for signs of damage and to ensure that all physical security mechanisms are in
place. Additionally, the CO should check the package for any irregular tears or openings. If damage is
found or tampering is suspected, the CO should immediately contact Ciena.

There is no special procedure to decommission the modem. Disconnecting fibers and removing the
encryption module from the system (powering down) results in all SSP zeroisation. There are no other
sanitization procedures to complete.

The module only supports an approved mode of operation. No additional configuration is required on
the Crypto Officer’s part except for installing the module since the provisioning of the module will be
taken care of by another Ciena module, the Control Processor.
