2.0 Cryptographic Module Specification
2.1 Description

Purpose and Use:
The Arista Crypto Module v3.0 [Software, Software IPsec] (hereafter referred to as “the module”)
is a Software Multichip standalone cryptographic module. The module provides cryptographic
services to applications running in the user space of the underlying operating system through a
C language Application Program Interface (API).

Module Type: Software

Arista Networks Inc. ‐ Arista Crypto Module v3.0 [Software, Software IPsec]

Module Embodiment: Multi-chip Standalone

Module Characteristics: None

Cryptographic Boundary:

The block diagram in Figure 1 shows the cryptographic boundary of the module, its interfaces
with the operational environment and the flow of information between the module and operator
(depicted through the arrows)

Figure 1 – Block diagram depicting the cryptographic boundary (in pink) and data flow between the module interfaces
and operator. The boundary also includes the instantiation of the cryptographic module in memory.

The TOEPP is the physical perimeter of the hardware platform listed in Table 2 – Tested
Operational Environment.

The module components consist of the fipscanister.o file in executable form. The fipscanister.o is
delivered in the product by statically linking to libcrypto.so. The Module performs no
communications other than with the calling application (the process that invokes the Module
services) and the OS syslog. The boundary also includes the instantiation of the module saved
in memory.

Per the FIPS 140-3 Cryptographic Module Validation Program Management Manual, Section
7.9, Arista affirms that the module remains compliant with the FIPS 140-3 validation when
operating on any general-purpose computer (GPC) provided that the GPC uses the specified
operating system/mode specified on the validation certificate, or another compatible operating
system (including Linux distros such as CentOS 6.x,7.x,8.x). The CMVP allows vendor porting
and re-compilation of a validated cryptographic module from the operational environment
specified on the validation certificate to an operational environment which was not included as
part of the validation testing as long as the porting rules are followed.

Note: The CMVP makes no statement as to the correct operation of the module or the security
strengths of the generated keys when so ported if the specific operational environment is not
listed on the validation certificate.

2.4 Excluded Components

There are no excluded components for the module.

2.5 Modes of Operation

Modes List and Description:

Name

Description

Approved Mode  Status Indicator

Approved Mode  Single Approved
Mode – selected
by calling the
FIPS_mode_set(
1) function.

Non-Approved
Mode

Selected by
default in
CloudEOS

Table B - Modes of Operation

Yes

No

The status indicator is a return value
1 from the FIPS_mode() function.

The status indicator is a return value
0 from the FIPS_mode() function.

When the module starts up successfully, after passing all the pre-operational self-tests, the
module is set to use Approved Mode by calling FIPS_mode_set with an argument of 1. Section
4.3 provides details on the service indicator implemented by the module.

Mode change instructions and status indicators:

To change to Approved mode, call FIPS_mode_set(1). To validate that the Approved Mode is
active, call FIPS_mode() and verify the return value is equal to “1”.

2.6 Approved Algorithms

The table below lists the approved security functions (or cryptographic algorithms) of the module,

2.7 Algorithm Specific Information

AES-GCM IV Generation

The module offers three AES GCM implementations. The GCM IV generation for these
implementations complies respectively with IG C.H under Scenario 1 and Scenario 2. The GCM
shall only be used in the context of the AES-GCM encryption executing under each scenario,
and using the referenced APIs explained next.

Scenario 1, TLS 1.2

For TLS 1.2, the module offers the GCM implementation via the functions
aes_gcm_tls_cipher, which calls CRYPTO_gcm128_encrypt_ctr32, and uses the context
of Scenario 1 of IG C.H. The module is compliant with SP800-52rev2 and the mechanism

Arista Networks Inc. ‐ Arista Crypto Module v3.0 [Software, Software IPsec]

for IV generation is compliant with RFC5288. The module supports acceptable AES-
GCM ciphersuites from Section 3.3.1 of SP800-52rev2.

The module explicitly ensures that the counter (the nonce_explicit part of the IV) does not
exhaust the maximum number of possible values of 264-1 for a given session key. If this
exhaustion condition is observed, the module returns an error indication to the calling
application, which will then need to either abort the connection, or trigger a handshake to
establish a new encryption key.

In the event the module’s power is lost and restored, the consuming application must
ensure that a new key for use with the AES-GCM key encryption or decryption under this
scenario shall be established.

Scenario 1, SSHv2

For SSH, the module offers the GCM implementation via the functions
CRYPTO_gcm128_encrypt_ctr32, and uses the context of Scenario 1 of IG C.H. The
module is compliant with RFCs 4252, 4253, and 5647.

In the event the module’s power is lost and restored, the consuming application must
ensure that a new key for use with the AES-GCM key encryption or decryption under this
scenario shall be established.

Scenario 1, IPsec-v3

For IPsec, the module offers the GCM implementation via the functions
CRYPTO_gcm128_encrypt_ctr32, and uses the context of Scenario 1 of IG C.H. The
module is compliant with RFCs 4106 and 5282. The module uses RFC 7296 compliant
IKEv2 to establish the shared secret SKEYSEED from which the AES-GCM encryption
keys are derived.

The module’s implementation of AES-GCM is used together with an application that runs
outside the module’s cryptographic boundary. This application negotiates the protocol
session’s keys and the value in the first 32 bits of the nonce. The construction of the last
64 bits of the nonce is deterministic and uses a counter.

The module explicitly ensures that the counter (the nonce_explicit part of the IV) does not
exhaust the maximum number of possible values of 264-1 for a given session key. If this
exhaustion condition is observed, the module returns an error indication to the calling
application, which will then need to either abort the connection, or trigger a handshake to
establish a new encryption key.

In the event the module’s power is lost and restored, the consuming application must
ensure that a new key for use with the AES-GCM key encryption or decryption under this
scenario shall be established.

Scenario 2, Random IV

In this implementation, the module offers the interfaces RAND_bytes for compliance with
Scenario 2 of IG C.H and SP800-38D Section 8.2.2. The AES-GCM IV is generated
randomly internal to the module using the module's approved DRBG. The DRBG seeds
itself from the entropy source. The GCM IV is 96 bits in length. Per Section 9, this 96-bit
IV contains 96 bits of entropy.

XTS-AES Key Generation

The module checks for Key_1 ≠ Key_2 before using the keys in the XTS-AES algorithm in
compliance with IG C.I.

2.8 RBG and Entropy

The module provides an SP800-90Arev1-compliant Deterministic Random Bit Generator
(DRBG) using CTR_DRBG mechanism with AES-256 for creation of key components of
asymmetric keys, and random number generation. Operators may instantiate and use the other
Approved DRBGs offered by the module. The module receives entropy passively and uses 384
bits of entropy to seed the DRBG.

2.9 Key Generation

For generating RSA, ECDSA and EC Diffie-Hellman keys, the module implements asymmetric
key generation services compliant with FIPS186-4 and using a DRBG compliant with SP800-
90Arev1.

The random value used in asymmetric key generation is obtained from the DRBG. In
accordance with FIPS 140-3 IG D.H, the cryptographic module performs Cryptographic Key
Generation (CKG) for asymmetric keys as per section 5.1 of SP800-133rev2 (vendor affirmed)
by obtaining a random bit string directly from an approved DRBG and that can support the
required security strength requested by the caller (without any V, as described in Additional
Comments 2 of IG D.H).

The module does not provide a dedicated service for generating symmetric keys. However,
symmetric keys can be derived using SP800-135rev1 for TLS KDF, IKE v1/2 KDF, and SSHv2
KDF algorithms, as well as SP800-108 counter KBKDF. This generation method maps to section
6.2 of SP800-133rev2.

2.10 Key Establishment

The module provides EC Diffie-Hellman and FFC Diffie-Hellman shared secret computation
compliant with SP800-56Arev3, in accordance with scenario 2 (1) of IG D.F. It also provides
RSA OAEP key transport as KTS-IFC compliant with SP 800-56Br2 in accordance with IG D.G.
and applications may transport keys as TLS, SSHv2, or IPsec protocol payload compliant to SP
800-38F in accordance with IG D.G.

Additionally, the module also supports key derivation using TLS 1.0/1.1, TLS 1.2, IKE v1, IKE v2,
SSHv2 KDF compliant to SP800-135rev1 and counter KBKDF compliant to SP800-108.

2.11 Industry Protocols

The module does not implement any industry protocols. However it provides the building blocks
to support the following protocols.

Note: no parts of the TLS v1.0/1.1, v1.2, SSHv2, or IPsec-v3 protocols, other than the approved
cryptographic algorithms and the KDFs, have been tested by the CAVP and CMVP.

2.12 Design and Rules

The module initializes upon power-on. After the pre-operational self-tests (POST) are
successfully concluded, the module automatically transitions to the operational state. In this
state, the module awaits service requests from the operator.

The operator must then manually set the module to approved mode, via the interface described
in Section “2.5 Modes of Operation”.

2.13 Initialization

Upon initializing the module by installing the module and setting the password, the operator must
then manually set the module to approved mode, via the interface described in Section “2.5
Modes of Operation”:

3.0 - Cryptographic Module Interfaces
3.1 Ports and Interfaces

As a Software module, the module interfaces are defined as Software or Firmware Module
Interfaces (SFMI), and there are no physical ports. The interfaces are mapped to the API
provided by the module, through which the operator can interact. The interfaces are listed in the
table below.

All data output via data output interface is inhibited under the following circumstances:

●  When the module is in POST mode
●  During zeroisation of data such as CSPs
●  When the module enters error state.

4.0 - Roles, Services and Authentication
4.1 Authentication Methods

The module supports Role-based authentication using passwords as the SP 800-140E
memorized secret. The module has a strength of authentication objective of at least 1/95^8, and
to achieve that over a one minute period the module enforces a minimum password length of 16

Arista Networks Inc. ‐ Arista Crypto Module v3.0 [Software, Software IPsec]

characters.  The password can be set by the calling application through the
“FIPS_set_password” API.

The module has procedural controls and enforces that an operator must set a password prior to
use of the module. The module is installed according to section 11.1 and the module
authentication mechanism is included within the module software and so automatically included
during that installation process.

Since the module enforces a minimum 16 character password length and there are 95 possible
ASCII characters (upper and lower case, digits, special characters), it has an authentication
strength of 95^16. Thus the false acceptance rate is 1/95^16. Assuming a very high-performing
CPU that runs at 4 GHz with 24 cores which means it can perform 4 billion * 24 instructions per
second, the probability of a successful random access within a minute is still extremely unlikely
at 1/95^16 * 4 billion * 24 cores * 60 seconds/min. It would take about 150 billion years to have a
1% chance of cracking the password in this scenario:

1/95^16 * 4 billion * 24 cores * 60 sec / min * 60 min / hr * 24 hr / day * 365 days / year *

150 billion = 0.0103

4.2 Roles

The module supports the Crypto Officer role only, whose authentication is performed by the
module using passwords. This sole role is implicitly assumed by the operator of the module
when performing a service after authentication.

Table 13 provides a mapping of services to the roles that can utilize them, in this case the sole
role of the module, and the service inputs and outputs.

Table 15 – Approved services

Service Indicator

The module implements a status indicator that indicates whether the invoked service is
approved. When approved mode is active, non-approved functions cannot be used. If a non-
approved function is used in approved mode, an error code of 0 indicating failure is returned and
the reason for failure is added to the error queue.

To verify if approved mode is active, the function FIPS_mode() should be called. This function is
described in Section “2.5 Modes of Operation”.

In addition to the return code, the module outputs syslog messages to indicate whether an
invoked service is approved. The usage is as follows:

STEP 1: Check the system log output buffer for existing log messages

STEP 2: Make a service call i.e., API function for performing a service

STEP 3: Check the system log output buffer for a new log message indicating which service was
invoked. For example, running the TLS key derivation service will generate a new log message
saying “OpenSSL: Key derivation service for TLS performed”. If there is no log message, that is
an indication that the invoked function was not an approved service.

5.1 Integrity Techniques

The integrity of the module is validated by comparing the module with a HMAC-SHA2-256 value
generated after the build of fipscanister.o, which is the FIPS Object Module. This generated
value is embedded into fipscanister.o before fipscanister.o is statically linked to libcrypto.so.
During runtime the FIPS_mode_set() function calculates the digest over fipscanister.o, excluding
the embedded hash value, and checks to see if the embedded value matches the calculated
digest.

5.2 Initiate on Demand

The module provides on-demand integrity test. The integrity test is performed by the On-
Demand Integrity Test service, which calls the FIPS_check_incore_fingerprint function. The
integrity test is also performed as part of the Pre-Operational Self-Tests. One can also initiate
the On Demand Integrity Test service by calling “openssl --fips” on the command line, which is a
calling application that runs the module’s self-test API function. A successful test will show “FIPS
mode is enabled”.

SSPs are provided to the module by the calling process and are destroyed when released by the
appropriate zeroisation function calls. The module does not perform persistent storage of SSPs.

9.2 SSP Input-Output Methods

The module does not support manual SSP entry or intermediate key generation output. The
module does not support entry and output of SSPs beyond the physical perimeter of the
operational environment. Except for services designed to wrap or unwrap an SSP the SSPs are
provided to the module via API input parameters in the plaintext form and output via API output
parameters in the plaintext form to and from the calling application running on the same
operational environment.  SSPs provided for unwrapping are input encrypted using KTS-IFC’s
RSA-OAEP_basic, and SSPs the module wrapped are output encrypted using KTS-IFC’s RSA-
OAEP_basic.

The output of plaintext CSPs requires two independent internal actions. Specifically, the first
action is creation of the cipher context to request the service and to hold the CSPs to be output
from the module. The second action is to process the ‘Key Generation’ service request using the

context created. Only after successful completion of this request, the generated CSP is output
via the API output parameter.

9.3 SSP Zeroisation Methods

The zeroisation is performed by the module overwriting zeroes or predefined values to the
memory location occupied by the SSP and further deallocating that area. The calling application,
interacting with the module, is responsible for calling the appropriate destruction functions using
the zeroisation APIs listed in the above table to zeroise the calling application’s copies of the
SSP. The completion of a zeroisation routine will indicate that a zeroisation procedure
succeeded.

10. Self‐tests
10.1 Pre-Operational Self-Tests

The module performs pre-operational tests automatically when the module is powered on. The
pre-operational self-tests ensure that the module is not corrupted and that the cryptographic
algorithms work as expected. The module transitions to the operational state only after the pre-
operational self-tests (and the cryptographic algorithm self-tests, which in this module are
executed automatically after the pre-operational self-tests) are passed successfully.

The types of pre-operational self-tests are described in the next sub-section.

Pre-Operational Software Integrity Test

The HMAC-SHA2-256 Conditional CAST is performed before checking the module integrity.
Then the integrity of the software component of the module is verified according to Section 5,
using HMAC-SHA2-256. If the comparison verification fails, the module transitions to the error
state (Section 10.4).

Pre-Operational Bypass and Critical Functions Tests

The module does not implement pre-operational bypass or critical functions tests. We note that
the entropy source is not within the cryptographic boundary of the module, instead passively
receiving entropy from the external entropy source. Thus, its critical functions tests are not
included in the module.

Cryptographic Algorithm Self-Tests

The module performs self-tests on FIPS-Approved cryptographic algorithms supported in the
approved mode of operation, using the tests shown in (and indicated as CASTs) and using the
provision of IG 10.3.A and IG 10.3.B for optimization of the number of self-tests. Data output
through the data output interface is inhibited during the self-tests. The cryptographic algorithm
self-tests are performed in the form of Known Answer Tests (KATs), in which the calculated
output is compared with the expected known answer (that are hard-coded in the module). A
failed match causes a failure of the self-test.

If any of these self-tests fails, the module transitions to error state and is aborted.

The module implements RSA and ECDSA key generation service and performs the respective
pairwise consistency test using sign and verify functions when the keys are generated (Table H).
In addition, SP 800-56a Rev3 conditional tests are run when ephemeral keypairs are created for
key agreement.

10.3 Periodic Self-Tests

On demand self-tests can be invoked by powering-off and reloading the module. This service
performs the same pre-operational test that includes integrity test and cryptographic algorithm
tests executed during power-up. The integrity test can also be performed on demand by calling
the FIPS_check_incore_fingerprint function. During the execution of the on-demand self-tests,
cryptographic services are not available, and no data output or input is possible.

If the module fails any of the self-tests, the module enters the error state. In the error state, the
module outputs the error through the status output interface and the abort function is called that
raises the SIGABRT signal, causing the program termination such that the module is no longer
operational. In the error state, as the module is no longer operational the data output interface is
inhibited. In order to recover from the Error state, the module needs to be rebooted.

11. Life-cycle Assurance
11.1 Startup Procedures

The cryptographic module is the fipscanister.o file, though Arista does not distribute this file on
its own. Instead it is embedded into the shared library libcrypto.so which is part of OpenSSL,
which in turn is distributed as part of the CloudEOS product, in the CloudEOS image accessible
through the Arista software downloads website. The CloudEOS product includes the CloudEOS
operating system, virtual machine, applications, OpenSSL, libcrypto.so, and fipscanister.o. While
there is no need for the fipscanister.o library to be built by the user at any point in time, the file
can be verified as the correct one by comparing the SHA256 hash sum. The SHA256 hash
should be 8b92b97d92571963b66649d0bb3ca62fba77100a316757e9487ad2091eddcc18. In
the Arista build process for building OpenSSL, this fipscanister.o file is linked into OpenSSL’s
libcrypto.so shared library file and OpenSSL is configured to use it.

When downloading the CloudEOS image, the SHA-256 hash of the image is also made
available. When an authorized operator downloads the CloudEOS image, they can also
download the hash file and compare the SHA-256 hash of the CloudEOS image to the one listed
in the file to make sure that the downloaded image is correct. Then they can install the
CloudEOS image onto the virtual machine.

     Upon completion of installation, the user can confirm that the correct module has been
installed by running the “show version” service should display the module base name and
version number, “Crypto Module: Arista Crypto Module v3.0“. Correct operation of the module
can be verified by running the on-demand self-test service as specified in Section 5 by calling
“openssl --fips” from bash.

11.5 End of Life

To  cease  using  the  module,  power  off  the  module.  The  module  does  not  possess  persistent
storage  of  SSPs.  The  SSP  value  only  exists  in  volatile  memory  and that  value  vanishes  when
the module is powered off. So as a first step for the secure sanitization, the module needs to be
powered off. Then for actual deprecation, the module will be upgraded to a newer version that is
approved.  This  upgrade  process  will  uninstall/remove  the  old/terminated  and  provide  a  new
replacement.
