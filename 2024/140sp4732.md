FIPS 140-3 Non-Proprietary Security Policy

1  General

1.1  This Security Policy Document

This Security Policy describes the features and design of the module named Qualcomm Pseudo Ran-
dom Number Generator using the terminology contained in the FIPS 140-3 specification. The FIPS
140-3  Security  Requirements  for  Cryptographic  Modules  specifies  the  security  requirements  that
will be satisfied by a cryptographic module utilized within a security system protecting sensitive but
unclassified information. The NIST/CCCS Cryptographic Module Validation Program (CMVP) validates
cryptographic modules to FIPS 140-3. Validated products are accepted by the Federal agencies of
both the USA and Canada for the protection of sensitive or designated information.
The Security Policy document is one document in a FIPS 140-3 Submission Package. In addition to
this document, the Submission Package contains:
•  The validation report prepared by the lab.

•  The Entropy Assessment Report (EAR) if applicable.

•  Other supporting documentation and additional references.

This Non-Proprietary Security Policy may be reproduced and distributed, but only whole and intact
and including this notice. Other documentation is proprietary to their authors.

1.2  How this Security Policy was Prepared

The vendor has provided the non-proprietary Security Policy of the cryptographic module, which was
further consolidated into this document by atsec information security together with other vendor-
supplied documentation. In preparing the Security Policy document, the laboratory formatted the
vendor-supplied documentation for consolidation without altering the technical statements therein
contained. The further refining of the Security Policy document was conducted iteratively throughout
the conformance testing, wherein the Security Policy was submitted to the vendor, who would then
edit, modify, and add technical contents. The vendor would also supply additional documentation,
which the laboratory formatted into the existing Security Policy, and resubmitted to the vendor for
their final editing.

This document is the non-proprietary FIPS 140-3 Security Policy for the Qualcomm Pseudo Random
Number Generator. It has a one-to-one mapping to the [SP 800-140B] starting with section B.2.1
named “General” that maps to section 1 in this document and ending with section B.2.12 named
“Mitigation of other attacks” that maps to section 12 in this document.

2.3  Description of Approved Mode

The Qualcomm Pseudo Random Number Generator supports only an approved mode which is en-
tered without any human assistance. All possible configurations entered via the registers are sup-
ported and do not violate the constraints of the approved mode.
When the Qualcomm Pseudo Random Number Generator is powered on, the pre-operational self-
test and cryptographic algorithm self-tests are executed automatically without any operator inter-
vention. The Qualcomm Pseudo Random Number Generator enters the operational mode automati-
cally if all self-tests complete successfully.
If any of self-tests fail during power-up, the Qualcomm Pseudo Random Number Generator goes into
error  state.  All  cryptographic  services  are  prohibited  while  in  error  state.  When  an  error  state  is
entered, the Qualcomm Pseudo Random Number Generator can be reset to reinitialize itself.

The status of the module can be determined by its availability. If the Qualcomm Pseudo Random
Number Generator is available, it has passed all self-tests. If it is unavailable, it is in the error state.

The table in section 4.2 lists all security functions of the module employed for approved services
and implemented modes of operation.

7  Physical Security

The Qualcomm Pseudo Random Number Generator Cryptographic Module is a single-chip firmware-
hybrid  module  which  conforms  to  the  level  2  requirements  for  physical  security.  The  Qualcomm
Pseudo Random Number Generator is a single chip enclosed in a production grade component.

At  the  time  of  manufacturing,  the  die  is  embedded  within  a  printed  circuit  board  (PCB),  which
prevents visibility into the internal circuity of the  Qualcomm Pseudo Random Number Generator.
The layering process which is used to embed the die into the PCB also prevents tampering of the
physical components without leaving tamper evidence.

The  Qualcomm  Pseudo  Random  Number  Generator  is  further  protected  by  being  enclosed  in
commercial  off  the  shelf  mobile  device  utilizing  production  grade  commercially  available
components  and  that  the  mobile  device  enclosure  completely  surrounds  the  Qualcomm  Pseudo
Random Number Generator.

There are no steps required to ensure that physical security is maintained.

9  Sensitive Security Parameter Management

9.1  Random Number Generation

The DRBG used to generate random bits is an SP 800-90Ar1 compliant SHA-256 Hash_DRBG without
prediction resistance. It processes a personalization string that is written by the calling application
into a hardware register for use by the module. The calling application has read/write access to the
hardware register that holds the personalization string.

The  DRBG  obtains  550  samples  of  4  bits  each as  entropy  input,  from  the  entropy source.  As  the
entropy source provides the min entropy rate of 0.420625 bits per sample, the  550 samples provide
231 bits of entropy, so the DRBG is limited to 231 bits of effective security strength in its output.
Consequently, the module generates random strings whose strengths are modified by available en-
tropy.  The  PUD  for  E67  can  be  found  at  https://csrc.nist.gov/CSRC/media/projects/cryptographic-
module-validation-program/documents/entropy/E67_PublicUse.pdf  and  the  PUD  for  E95  can  be

9.3  SSP Generation, Entry and Output

The module does not provide any SSP generation service or perform SSP generation for any of its
approved algorithms. The caller of the DRBG could use the random strings output for SSP generation,
but this service is not explicitly provided by the module.

The module does not provide any kind of SSP establishment, entry, or output.

9.4  SSP Storage and Zeroization

The entropy input string and internal state used by the DRBG are generated internally by the hard-
ware and are not accessible externally to the Qualcomm Pseudo Random Number Generator.
Zeroization of the DRBG CSPs is accomplished by a reset event of the SoC. The registers for the
CSPs will implicitly be set to zero upon the reset, indicating the zeroization was successful.

10 Self-tests

Self-tests implemented by the module consist of the pre-operational integrity test and cryptographic
algorithm self-test used for algorithm implementations. All self-tests are automatically performed
without any operator intervention during power-up of the module (with the exception of the physical
entropy  source  continuous  health  tests).  This  includes  the  pre-operational  integrity  test  and  the
cryptographic  algorithm  self-tests.  While  the  module  is  executing  the  self-tests,  services  are  not
available, and input and output are inhibited.

For information about the error state, refer to Section 10.4.

10.1 Pre-operational tests

The firmware integrity test is run at startup of the module. The CAST for SHA-256 is executed before
the integrity test is run.

10.2 Conditional self-tests

The  module  performs  self-tests  on  all  FIPS  approved  cryptographic  algorithms  as  part  of  the  ap-
proved services using the tests shown in Table 10. The module transitions to the operational state
only  after  the  cryptographic  algorithm  self-tests  are  passed  successfully.  The  physical  entropy
source continuous health tests are performed throughout the operation of the module.

10.4 Error States

If any of the pre-operational self-tests or conditional self-tests fail, the Qualcomm Pseudo Random
Number Generator will enter the error state. Data output is prohibited, and no further cryptographic
operation is allowed in the error state. This is performed by the control logic and prevents external
usage when an error is detected.

To recover from the error state, re-initialization is possible by successful execution of the power up
tests, which can be triggered by either a power-off/power-on cycle or the receipt of a reset event.
Once locked, the Qualcomm Pseudo Random Number Generator will only respond to a reset which
will cause it to re-execute the power up tests. If the error persists, the Qualcomm Pseudo Random
Number Generator will remain unavailable.

11 Life-cycle assurance

11.1 Delivery and Operation

The Qualcomm Pseudo Random Number Generator is a single chip module in the Snapdragon 8 Gen
1  Mobile  Platform,  Snapdragon  8+  Gen  1  Mobile  Platform,  Qualcomm  QCM6490  and  Qualcomm
QCS6490. The chips are delivered from the vendor via a trusted delivery courier. Upon delivery, the
customer can detect any potential tampering by visually inspecting the chips. Any tampering will
result in obvious damage or scratches and will likely render the chips non-functional. Once the prod-
uct is received by the customer and powered up the self-tests defined in Section 10 will be executed.

11.2 End of Life

As stated in Section 9.4, the module does not possess persistent storage of SSPs. The SSP value
only  exists  in  volatile  memory  and  that  value  is  zeroized  when  the  module  is  powered  off.  The
procedure for secure sanitization of the module at the end of life is simply to power it off, which is
the action of zeroization of the SSPs (Section 9.4). As a result of this sanitization via power-off, the
SSP is removed from the module, so that the module may either be distributed to other operators
or disposed.

11.3 Crypto Officer Guidance

There is no specific crypto officer guidance required for the module.

11.4 Configuration Management

ClearCase, a version control system from IBM/Rational, is used to manage the revision control of the
hardware code (Verilog code) and hardware documentation. The ClearCase version control system
provides version control, workspace management, parallel development support, and build auditing.
The Verilog code is maintained within the ClearCase database used by Qualcomm Technologies, Inc.
Perforce Visual Client(P4V), a version control system from Perforce, is used to manage the revision
control of the Qualcomm firmware code. The Perforce Visual Client provides version control, branch-
ing and merging of code lines, and concurrent development.
