Section 2 – Cryptographic Module Specification

KIOXIA FIPS TC58NC1132GTC Crypto Sub-Chip (listed in Section2.1 Product Version) is used

for solid state drive data security. The CM is a single chip hardware module implemented as a

sub-chip compliant with IG 2.3.B in the TC58NC1132GTC 0003 SoC (see Figure 1 in Section 7).

Overall Security Rating of the CM is Level2 (See Table 1 in Section 1 for individual security area

levels). The CM is embedded in TCG Enterprise compliant solid state drive controllers which

provides user data encryption/decryption through build-in HW engines. The CM is responsible

for providing key management, access control of stored user data, and various cryptographic

algorithm for the solid state drive.

The CM has multiple cryptographic services using approved algorithms, but they do not support

the degraded operation. The physical boundary of the CM is the TC58NC1132GTC 0003 SoC and

the logical boundary of the CM is TC58NC1132GTC CRPT module.

The CM has one approved mode of operation and CM is always in approved mode of operation

after initial operations are performed (See Section 11). In approved mode, the CM provides

services defined in Table 7 in Section 4.2.

1  ECB mode is used as a prerequisite of XTS mode. ECB is not directly used in services of the

Cryptographic Module. The CM performs a check that the XTS Key1 and XTS Key2 are different

according to IG C.I. AES-XTS is only used for encryption/decryption of data stored in solid state

drives equipped with this CM.

Table 5  ‐  Roles, Service Commands, Input and output

The CM supports the configuration of roles and services. The authenticated operator is expected

to configure locked bands for data storage, the associated role and the lock-based

authentication data (PIN) per Table 6 (refer to section 11 for detail settings to maintain secure

operation). Bands that are not configured are considered unprotected or plaintext. This

configuration enables Data Read/Write service using the lock-based authentication model (IG

4.1.A). To Read/Write data from/to each band, an operator must unlock the bands with

appropriate authenticated roles. Once the bands are unlocked, Read and Write access to the

bands must be controlled by a trusted operator outside of the module who has been

firmware is verified (RSASSA-PKCS#1-v1_5).

authenticated as the associated role until powered off. The module prevents Data read/write

service for locked bands. If Read and Write access needs to be inhibited prior to power off, the

operator who authenticates the role must set the bands to the locked state again.

30 / 264 < 1 / 100,000

Table 6  ‐  Identification and Authentication Policy

The  CM  performs  role  authentication  by  comparing  whether  the  PIN  entered  by  the  user

matches the information stored inside the CM. PINs are hashed with SHA-256 to store them on

the CM. The PIN entered by the user is hashed and compared to the stored PIN hash.

PINs can be changed by executing the Set PIN Service (see Section4.2) with appropriate roles

authenticated. The CM refuses to set a PIN less than 8 bytes, and responds with an error if such
a setting is attempted. Therefore, the probability that a random attempt will succeed is 1 / 264

< 1 / 1,000,000 (the CM accepts any value (0x00-0xFF) as each byte of PIN). The CM waits

2sec when authentication attempt fails, so the maximum number of authentication attempts is

30 times in 1 min. Consequently, the probability that random attempts in 1min will succeed is
30 / 264 < 1 / 100,000.

Section 5 – Software/Firmware Security

Firmware Security of components in this CM is shown below.

ROM Code:

・  Form of the executable code: ELF format

・  Integrity verification method: 32bit CRC

・  Method for integrity test on demand: Power cycling

Firmware image (User Code):

・  Form of the executable code: ELF format

・  Integrity verification method: Approved signature verification (see table 3)

・  Method for integrity test on demand: Power cycling

Section 6 – Operational Environment

Operational  Environment  requirements  are  not  applicable  because  the  CM  does  not  employ

operating  systems  and  operates  in  a  non-modifiable  environment  that  is  the  CM  cannot  be

modified and no code can be added or deleted.

11

Oct  22,  2024

Section 7 – Physical Security

The CM is a sub-chip enclosed in a single chip that is an opaque package. Gathering information

of the module’s internal construction or components is impossible without forcing the package

to open. In this case, it is confirmed package damage as a tamper-evidence. Operators of the

CM can ensure that the physical security is maintained to confirm the package has no obvious

attack damage. If the operator discovers tamper evidence, the CM should be removed.

Table 10  ‐  Non-Deterministic Random Number Generation Specification

For the Entropy Source listed in the table above, self-tests are performed each time before data

is obtained (see Section 10 for details of these self-tests). When these tests detect that the

Entropy Source cannot generate the sufficient amount of entropy, the CM is transient to error

state. The CM can be recovered from the error state by rebooting the module, and the obtaining

of  Entropy  data  is  attempted  again.  If  the  CM  continuously  enters  in  error  state  in  spite  of

several trials of reboot, the CM may be sent back to factory to recover from error state.

Table 11  ‐  Self Tests

stopping the startup sequence)

As shown in the table above, self-tests are performed automatically at the CM startup and

before execution certain security functions. Operator can also initiate self-test on-demand for

periodic testing by using the Reset service which is automatically invoked when the module is

powered-off and powered-on (rebooted).

If the self-tests fail, the CM reports error status and enters to the error state. In this case, the

CM must be powered-off to clear error condition. When power-on is executed again, self-tests

are also executed like an on-demand operator reset. If the CM continuously enters in error state

in spite of several trials of reboot, the CM may be sent back to factory to recover from error

state.

Section 11 – Life-cycle Assurance

In the SSD’s manufacturing process, installation is executed as below:

1. The Firmware  described in Section 2.1 is downloaded into the CM.

2. Initial SSPs are generated.

3. Initial authentication information is set to the CM.

4.  System  area  including  SSPs  generated  in  Step2  and  Step3  are  encrypted  and  calculated

message authentication code.

Initial operations to setup this CM are following:

1.  Load Firmware  into the CM.

2.  Load System area including SSPs into the CM.

3.  Execute Range state setting method.

4.  Execute Download port setting method.

The  CM  switches  to  approved  mode  after  the  initial  operation  success.  When  the  initial

operation succeeds, the CM indicates success on the Status Output interface. Users can confirm

Oct  22,  2024

that  the  CM  is  in  approved  mode  by  executing  Show  Status  service  and  checking  that  the

startup is successfully completed.

For secure operation, the following settings must be maintained:

  Data Locking Protection is Enabled

  Each Band is set to be locked when power-on. Bands that are not configured are considered

unprotected or plaintext.

(Refer to SSD setting procedure11  )

As described in Section 2, the CM is used by being embedded in the solid state drive. Therefore,

there are no maintenance requirements for the CM alone.  Guidance for this module is provided

to solid state drive developers who embed the CM.  The usage and maintenance of solid state

drives with the CM built-in are outside of the scope of this document.

Section 12 – Mitigation of Other Attacks

The CM does not mitigate other attacks beyond the scope of FIPS 140-3 requirements.

11  For maintaining secure condition, the SSD needs several setting at least.

Owners of the SSD that embeds the CM must use it securely according to the followings:

1.  Both ReadLockEnabled and WriteLockEnabled are set to “True” for each band (included

Global Range) and it must not be modified.

2.  For each band, “Power Cycle” of LockOnReset setting is not change.
