Section 2 – Cryptographic Module Specification

KIOXIA FIPS TC58NC1030GTB Crypto Sub-Chip (listed in Section2.1 Product Version) is used

for solid state drive data security. The CM is a single chip hardware module implemented as a

sub-chip compliant with IG 2.3.B in the TC58NC1030GTB 0002 SoC (see Figure 1 in Section 7).

Overall Security Rating of the CM is Level 2 (See Table 1 in Section 1 for individual security area

levels). The CM is embedded in TCG OPAL compliant solid state drive controllers which provides

user data encryption/decryption through build-in HW engines.

The  CM  provides  various  cryptographic  services  using  approved  algorithms.  The  CM  has

multiple functions, but they do not support the degraded operation. The physical boundary of

the  CM  is  the  TC58NC1030GTB  0002  SoC  and  the  logical  boundary  of  the  CM  is

TC58NC1030GTB CRPT module.

The CM has one approved mode of operation and CM is always in approved mode of operation

after initial operations are performed (See Section 11). In approved mode, the CM provides

services defined in Table 7 in Section 4.2.

Section 2.1 – Product Version

The CM is validated with the following versions:

Physical single-chip

Note 1: The “CAVP Cert” of KTS comes from the fact that KTS is composed of AES256-CBC and HMAC-SHA2-256 (#A2402).

Note 2: There are algorithms, modes, and keys that have been CAVP tested but not used by the module. Only the algorithms,

modes/methods, and key lengths/curves/moduli shown in this table are used by the module.

Table 3  ‐  Approved Algorithms

The  CM  does  not  have  any  Non-approved  algorithms  allowed  in  the  approved  mode  of

operation.

1  ECB mode is used as a prerequisite of XTS mode. ECB is not directly used in services of the

Cryptographic Module. The CM performs a check that the XTS Key1 and XTS Key2 are different

according to IG C.I. AES-XTS is only used for encryption/decryption of data stored in solid state

drives equipped with this CM.

Table 5  ‐  Roles, Service Commands, Input and output

The CM supports the configuration of roles and services. The authenticated operator is expected

to configure locked bands for data storage, the associated role and the lock-based

authentication data (PIN) per Table 5 (refer to section 11 for detail settings to maintain secure

operation). Bands that are not configured are considered unprotected or plaintext. This

configuration enables Data Read/Write service using the lock-based authentication model (IG

4.1.A). To Read/Write data from/to each band, an operator must unlock the bands with

appropriate authenticated roles. Once the bands are unlocked, Read and Write access to the

bands must be controlled by a trusted operator outside of the module who has authenticated

the associated role until powered off. The module prevents Data read/write service for locked

bands. If Read and Write access needs to be inhibited prior to power off, the operator who

authenticates the role must set the bands to the locked state again.

Note 1: All roles to be authenticated are FIPS Crypto Officer

Note 2: There are LockingSP.Users from user 1 to user 192, but user 3 to user 191 are omitted in the table above.

Table 6  ‐  Identification and Authentication Policy

The CM provides a role-based PIN authentication function. The CM stores PINs that has been

previously hashed with SHA2-256, and verifies the PIN entered by the operator matches the

stored information at the time of authentication.

PINs can be changed by executing the Set PIN Service (see Section4.2) with appropriate roles

authenticated. The CM refuses to set a PIN less than 8 bytes, and responds with an error if such

9

Dec  23,  2024

a setting is attempted. Therefore, the probability that a random attempt will succeed is 1 / 264

< 1 / 1,000,000 (the CM accepts any value (0x00-0xFF) as each byte of PIN). The CM waits 1ms

when  authentication  attempt  fails,  so  the  maximum  number  of  authentication  attempts  is

60,000  times  in  1  min.    Consequently,  the  probability  that  random  attempts  in  1min  will
succeed is 60,000 / 264 < 1 / 100,000.

Initial PINs of AdminSP.Admin1, LockingSP.Admin2-4 and LockingSP.User1-192 are set to null

(i.e.,  data  length  is  0).  These  role’s  authentication  data  are  need  to  be  replaced  upon  the

first-time  authentication.  Otherwise,  the  operator  who  assumes  these  roles  cannot  execute

services except Set PIN and services that does not need authorized roles.

Note 1: “CKG(Hash_DRBG)” means direct use of Hash_DRBG output as a key.

Note 2: A cryptographic module is required to provide services “Show module’s versioning information”, “Show status”,

“Perform self-tests”, “Perform approved security functions” and “Perform zeroisation”. In this CM, “Show module’s information”

and “Show status” are included in the Show Status service and “Perform self-tests” is included in the Reset service. “Perform

zeroisation” is executed by the Zeroisation service. All other services fall under “Perform approved security functions”.

Table 7  ‐  Approved services

The CM does not provide Non-approved services.

Section 5 – Software/Firmware Security

Firmware Security of components in this CM is shown below.

ROM Code:

・  Form of the executable code: ELF format

・  Integrity verification method: 32bit CRC

・  Method for integrity test on demand: Power cycling

Firmware image (User Code):

・  Form of the executable code: ELF format

・  Integrity verification method: Approved signature verification (RSASSA-PKCS#1-v1_5, see

table 3)

・  Method for integrity test on demand: Power cycling

The CM supports the partial loading that replaces the current Firmware image, excluding the

ROM Code, with a new Firmware image loaded from outside the module. In this case the CM

becomes another validated one.

Section 6 – Operational Environment

Operational  Environment  requirements  are  not  applicable  because  the  CM  does  not  employ

operating  systems  and  operates  in  a  limited  operational  environment  under  the  FIPS  140-3

definitions.

Section 7 – Physical Security

The CM is a sub-chip enclosed in a single chip that is an opaque package. Gathering information

of the module’s internal construction or components is impossible without forcing the package

to open. In this case, it is confirmed package damage as a tamper-evidence. Operators of the

CM can ensure that the physical security is maintained to confirm the package has no obvious

attack damage. If the operator discovers tamper evidence, the CM should be removed.

Table 10  ‐  Non-Deterministic Random Number Generation Specification

For the Entropy Source listed in the table above, self-tests are performed each time before data

is obtained (see Section 10 for details of these self-tests). When these tests detect that the

Entropy Source cannot generate the sufficient amount of entropy, the CM is transient to error

state. The CM can be recovered from the error state by rebooting the module, and the obtaining

of  Entropy  data  is  attempted  again.  If  the  CM  continuously  enters  in  error  state  in  spite  of

several trials of reboot, the CM may be sent back to factory to recover from error state.

9  The Entropy Source is a hardware module inside the CM boundary. The Entropy Source

supplies the Hash_DRBG with 1024 bits entropy input. From Table 10 this input contains about

384 bits of entropy, which is sufficient entropy to obtain 256 bits of security strength.

Table 11  ‐  Self Tests

startup sequence)

As shown in the table above, self-tests are performed automatically at the CM startup and

before execution certain security functions. Operator can also initiate self-test on-demand for

periodic testing by using the Reset service which is automatically invoked when the module is

powered-off and powered-on (rebooted).

If the self-tests fail, the CM reports error status and enters to the error state. In this case, the

CM must be powered-off to clear error condition. When power-on is executed again, self-tests

are also executed like an on-demand operator reset. If the CM continuously enters in error state

in spite of several trials of reboot, the CM may be sent back to factory to recover from error

state.

Section 11 – Life-cycle Assurance

In the SSD’s manufacturing process, installation is executed as below:

1. The Firmware  described in Section 2.1 is downloaded into the CM.

2. Initial SSPs are generated.

3. Initial authentication information is set to the CM.

4.  System  area  including  SSPs  generated  in  Step2  and  Step3  are  encrypted  and  calculated

message authentication code.

Initial operations to setup this CM are following:

1.  Load Firmware  into the CM.

10  Firmware load test  is also run at the time of Power-up, and the integrity of the Firmware

loaded into the CM can be confirmed.

19

Dec  23,  2024

2.  Load system area including SSPs into the CM.

3.  Execute range state setting method.

4.  Execute download port setting method.

5.  Execute service execution state setting method.

6.  Execute namespace setting method.

The  CM  switches  to  approved  mode  after  the  initial  operation  success.  When  the  initial

operation succeeds, the CM indicates success on the Status Output interface. Users can confirm

that  the  CM  is  in  approved  mode  by  executing  Show  Status  service  and  checking  that  the

startup is successfully completed.

For secure operation, the following settings must be maintained:

  Data Locking Protection is Enabled

  Each Band is set to be locked when power-on. Bands that are not configured are considered

unprotected or plaintext.

(Refer to SSD setting procedure11  )

As described in Section 2, the CM is used by being embedded in the solid state drive. Therefore,

there are no maintenance requirements for the CM alone.  Guidance for this module is provided

to solid state drive developers who embed the CM.  The usage and maintenance of solid state

drives with the CM built-in are outside of the scope of this document.

Section 12 – Mitigation of Other Attacks

The CM does not mitigate other attacks beyond the scope of FIPS 140-3 requirements.

11  For maintaining secure condition, the SSD needs several setting at least.

Owners of the SSD that embeds the CM must use it securely according to the followings:

1.  TCG LockingSP is enabled by Activate method.

2.  Both ReadLockEnabled and WriteLockEnabled are set to “True” for each band (included

Global Range) and it must not be modified.

3.  For each band, “Power Cycle" of LockOnReset setting is not change.

4.  If the LockingSP has been made disabled, the Activate method is re-executed before

PowerCycle is performed.
