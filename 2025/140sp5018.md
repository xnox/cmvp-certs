Introduction

I.1.

Scope

This document is a non-proprietary Security Policy for the Samsung NVMe TCG Opal SSC SEDs PM1743 Series, hereinafter
referred to as the “cryptographic module” or “module.” The SSD (Solid State Drive) satisfies all applicable FIPS 140-3 security
level 1 requirements for a ‘Hardware Module,’ supporting TCG Opal SSC-based SED (Self-Encrypting Drive) features designed
to protect against unauthorized access to user data stored in its NAND Flash memories. The built-in AES hardware engines
in the cryptographic module’s controller provide on-the-fly encryption and decryption of user data without performance
loss. The SED’s design also enables instantaneous sanitization of user data via cryptographic erase.

2.1.  Cryptographic Boundary

This firmware version, within the scope of this validation, must be validated through the FIPS 140-3 CMVP. Any other firmware
loaded into this module is beyond the scope of this validation and requires a separate FIPS 140-3 validation.

The  following  photographs  depict  the  top  and  bottom  views  of  the  cryptographic  module.  The  multiple-chip  standalone
cryptographic module comprises of both hardware and firmware components, all enclosed within two aluminum alloy cases.
These cases serve as the cryptographic boundary of the module.

Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. SSD FIPS 140-3 Security Policy

5.  Software/Firmware Security

-

The integrity of the module’s executable firmware (OPP9TA6A_DC_2048.bin) is verified using ECDSA SigVer P-384 (A2255)
with SHA2-384 (A2248) for firmware integrity testing of the following components:

▪  Boot Loader - ECDSA SigVer P-384 (A2255) with SHA2-384 (A2248)

▪  Main Firmware - ECDSA SigVer P-384 (A2255) with SHA2-384 (A2248)

-

The operator can initiate the firmware integrity tests on-demand by power-cycling the module.

14

Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. SSD FIPS 140-3 Security Policy

6.  Operational Environment

-

-

-

-

The cryptographic module operates in a limited operational environment, consisting of the module’s firmware. This module
does not have an operating system but is designed in a manner to allow controlled, validated firmware modifications by an
operator. This operational environment does not require any specific security rules, settings, configurations, or restrictions
to be set.

The cryptographic module does not provide any general-purpose operating system to the operator.

Firmware download is only available for CMVP validated firmware versions. Unauthorized modification of the firmware is
prevented by the pre-operational firmware integrity test and conditional firmware load test.

Since the cryptographic module is zeroised through the procedure for using maintenance role, it is  restricted to prevent
uncontrolled access to CSPs and uncontrolled modifications of SSPs.

15

Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. SSD FIPS 140-3 Security Policy

7.  Physical Security

The following physical security mechanisms are implemented in the cryptographic module:

•

Production grade components.

The cryptographic module supports the Maintenance role. To assume the Maintenance role, operators must comply with the
following rules:

•

•

•

The operator must zeroise all SSPs listed in Table 11 by invoking the Revert service in the Table 8 and initiate the
Power on reset before entering the Maintenance role.

To exit the Maintenance role, the operator must procedurally perform the Revert service in the Table 8 and perform
a power-on reset of the module. Finally, the operator performing the Show Status service  in Table 8 confirms the
original firmware version listed in the Table 3 remains unchanged.

The operator is responsible for managing the module's JTAG port and should conduct regular inspections associated
with the enabled JTAG port as frequently as possible in order to prevent potential security risks such as potential
code modifications with no firmware load test, reading and writing of register information or other impactful security
changes.

16

Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. SSD FIPS 140-3 Security Policy

8.  Non-Invasive Security

-

The module does not implement any non-invasive attack mitigation techniques. Therefore, this section is not applicable.

17

Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. SSD FIPS 140-3 Security Policy

9.  Sensitive Security Parameters Management

-

-

-

-

Temporary SSPs and SSPs stored in volatile memory are automatically zeroized upon power-on reset.

The module performs zeroization by overwriting the target SSP with random values generated by the DRBG.

The module does not import or export SSPs.

All SSPs in volatile memory, including HW SFR, are automatically zeroised instantly either after key generation/use or
upon performing power-on-reset, depending on the characteristics of volatile memory.

Details

The entropy source provides an
estimated min-entropy output of 0.58
bits per bit. The DRBG is seeded with
768 bits of entropy input data from
the entropy source. Therefore, the
DRBG is seeded with at least 384-bits
of entropy before generating SSPs.

11. Life-Cycle Assurance

The  cryptographic  module  operates  in  the  Approved  mode  of  operation  by  default  upon  shipment  from  the  vendor’s
manufacturing site and does not support a non-approved mode of operation. Section 11.1 provides guidance on the rules for
secure  installation  and  operation.  Operators  must  follow  this  guidance  to  ensure  the  cryptographic  module  operates  in
compliance with FIPS 140-3 security level 1 requirements.

11.1.  Secure Installation

•

Identify the firmware version in the device

-

Confirm  that  the  firmware  version  is  equivalent  to  the  version(s)  listed  in  this  document  via  NVM  express
Identify Controller command.

•
•

The cryptographic module shall maintain logical separation of data input, data output, control input, status output,
and power.
The cryptographic module shall not output CSPs in any form.
The cryptographic module shall use the Approved DRBG for generating all cryptographic keys.
The cryptographic module shall enforce a limited operational environment by the secure firmware load test using
ECDSA with SHA-384.
The cryptographic module shall provide a production-grade cryptographic boundary.
The Cryptographic module enters the error state upon failure of Self-tests. most commands except for supported
command from the Host (General Purpose Computer (GPC) outside the cryptographic boundary) are rejected in the
error state and the IO command returns Namespace Not Ready (SC=0x82, SCT=0x0), the other commands return
Internal Error (SC=0x6, SCT=0x0) defined in NVMe specification via the status output. Cryptographic services and
data output are explicitly inhibited when in the error state. When the module fails FW Integrity test performed by
Mask ROM, the module will fail to boot; module will not service any requests or provide any status output (module
hangs).
The cryptographic module satisfies the requirements of FIPS 140-3 IG C.I (i.e. key_1 ≠ key_2)
The module generates at a minimum 256 bits of entropy for use in key generation.
Bypass capability is not applicable to the cryptographic module.
The module generates symmetric keys which are unmodified outputs from the DRBG.
As specified in NIST SP 800-132, keys derived from passwords/passphrases may only be used in storage applications.
AES-XTS is only approved for storage applications.
If you require the “Samsung SED Product Manual”, kindly reach out to the vendor contact information that is
posted in certification.
