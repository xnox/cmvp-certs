Introduction

Federal Information Processing Standards Publication 140-3 — Security Requirements for Cryptographic
Modules specifies requirements for cryptographic modules to be deployed in a Sensitive but Unclassified
environment. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and Canadian Centre for Cyber
Security (CCCS) Cryptographic Module Validation Program (CMVP) run the FIPS 140-3 program. The NVLAP
accredits independent testing labs to perform FIPS 140-3 testing; the CMVP validates modules meeting
FIPS 140-3 validation. Validated is the term given to a module that is documented and tested against the
FIPS 140-3 criteria.

More information is available on the CMVP website at:
https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/cryptographic-module-validation-program.

Module Usage and Cryptographic Boundary

The cryptographic module provides for an encrypted connection, using SSH, between the management
station and the module.

The cryptographic module’s operational environment is a limited operational environment. The images
below depict the cryptographic boundary of the hardware module (the entirety of the module/chassis).
This includes the Routing Engine (RE). No components have been excluded from the cryptographic
boundary of the module.

Figure 2 – High-level PTX1000 Block Diagram

The module claims an overall Security Level of 1 with all individual sections at a Security Level 1 with the
exceptions of Roles, Services and Authentication (claimed at Security Level 3). The module does not
implement any non-invasive security mitigations or mitigations of other attacks and thus the
requirements per these sections are inapplicable.

Modes Of Operation

The module supports one Approved mode of operation and a non-Approved mode of operation. The
module must always be zeroised when switching between the Approved mode of operation and the
non-Approved mode of operation and vice versa.

Approved Mode

The hardware versions contained in Table 2, with Junos OS 22.4R2.8 installed, contain one Approved
mode of operation and a non-Approved mode of operation. The Junos OS 22.4R2.8 firmware image
must be installed on the module. The module is configured during initialization by the Crypto Officer to
operate in the Approved mode or the non-Approved mode. The Crypto Officer can place the module in

Version 1.0
Public Material – May be reproduced only in its original entirety (without revision).

Page 6 of 47

the Approved mode of operation by following the instructions specified in Section 11 Life-Cyle
Assurance in this document (Crypto Officer guidance).

The Crypto Officer can verify that the cryptographic module is in the Approved mode by observing the
console prompt and running the “show version” command. When operating in the Approved mode, the
prompt will read “<operator>@<device name>:fips#” (e.g. crypto-officer@ptx1000fips#).  The “show
version” command will allow the Crypto Officer to verify that the validated firmware version is running
on the module. The Crypto Officer can also use the “show system fips chassis level” command (returns
“level 1”) to determine if the module is operating in the Approved mode.

The Approved mode is entered when the module is configured for it and successfully passes all self-tests
(both pre-operational and conditional cryptographic algorithm self-tests (CASTs)) .

Non-Approved Mode

The cryptographic module supports a non-Approved mode of operation. When operated in the non-
Approved mode of operation, the module supports non-Approved algorithms identified below in this
section as well as the algorithms supported in the Approved mode of operation. The Crypto Officer can
place the module into the non-Approved mode of operation by following the instructions in the Section
11 Life-Cyle Assurance in this document (Crypto Officer guidance).

Degraded Operation

The module does not support a degraded mode of operation.

Overall Security Rules of Operation

The module design corresponds to the security rules below. The term shall in this context specifically
refers to a requirement for correct usage of the module in the Approved mode; all other statements
indicate a security rule implemented by the module.

1.  The module clears previous authentications on power cycle.
2.  When the module has not been placed in a valid role, the operator does not have access to any

cryptographic services.

3.  Self-tests do not require any operator action.
4.  Data output is inhibited during SSP generation, self-test execution, zeroisation, and error states.
5.  Status information does not contain SSPs or sensitive data that if misused could lead to a

compromise of the module.

6.  There are no restrictions on which SSPs are zeroised by the zeroisation service.
7.  The module does not support a maintenance interface or role.

8.  The module does not output intermediate key values.
9.  The module does not output plaintext CSPs.
10. The Crypto officer shall verify that the firmware image to be loaded on the module is a FIPS 140-
3 validated image. If any non-validated firmware image is loaded the module will no longer be a
validated module.

11. The Crypto Officer shall retain control of the module while zeroisation is in process.
12. The virtual chassis feature is not supported in Approved mode and shall not be configured on

the module.

13. The module shall not be configured to use a radius server and the radius server capability shall

be disabled.

14. No parts of the SSH protocol, other than the approved cryptographic algorithms and the KDFs,

have been tested by the CAVP and CMVP.

4.  Roles, Services, and Authentication

The module supports two roles: Crypto Officer (CO) and User. The module supports concurrent operators
but does not support a maintenance role and/or bypass capability. The module enforces the separation of
roles using identity-based operator authentication. The module implements two forms of identity-based
authentication, username, and password over the console and SSH connections, as well as username and
an ECDSA or RSA public key-based authentication over SSH.

The Crypto Officer role configures and monitors the module via a console or SSH connection. As root or
super-user, the Crypto Officer has permission to view and configure passwords and public keys within the
module.  The  User  role  monitors  the  module  via  the  console  or  SSH.  The  User  role  does  not  have  the
permission to modify the configuration.

above the previous (e.g.,
4th failed attempt = 10-
second delay, 5th failed
attempt = 15-second
delay, 6th failed attempt =
20- second delay, 7th
failed attempt = 25-
second delay);
This leads to a maximum
of 7 possible attempts in a
one-minute period for
each getty;
The best approach for the
attacker would be to
disconnect after 4 failed
attempts and wait for a
new getty to be spawned;
This would allow the
attacker to perform
roughly 9.6 attempts per
minute (576 attempts per
hour/60 mins); this would
be rounded down to 9 per
minute, because there is
no such thing as 0.6
attempts;
The probability of a
success with multiple
consecutive attempts in a
one-minute period is
9/(96^10), which is less
than 1/100,000

2.  ECDSA signature
verification: SSH public-
key authentication;
The module supports
ECDSA (P-256, P-384, and
P-521), which has a
minimum equivalent
computational resistance
to attack of either 2128,
2192 or 2256 depending on
the curve;
Thus, the probability of a
successful random
attempt is 1/(2128), which
is less than 1/1,000,000
(million)

Software/Firmware Security

The module performs the firmware integrity check using ECDSA P-256 with SHA2-256. The operator can
initiate the integrity test on demand by rebooting the module. The module firmware image is delivered
in the form of a pre-compiled tarball (.tgz). The module supports loading of firmware from an external
source and a firmware load test using ECDSA P-256 with SHA2-256 is performed in support of the load.

contained within the module, i.e., the tested configurations listed in Table 2 of this document. Security rules
and restrictions for configuration of the operational environment have been specified in Section 2 (Overall
Security  Rules  of  Operation)  and  Section 11  (Installing  The  Firmware  Image  and  Enabling  the  Approved

Physical Security

The module’s  physical  embodiment  is  that of  a  multi-chip  standalone  meeting  Level 1 Physical  Security
requirements. The module is completely enclosed in a rectangular nickel or clear zinc coated, cold rolled
steel, plated steel and brushed aluminum enclosure. The module enclosure is made of production grade
materials. There are no ventilation holes, gaps, slits, cracks, slots, or crevices that would allow for any sort
of observation of any component contained within the cryptographic boundary. No actions are required by
the operator to ensure that physical security is maintained.

Each time the module is powered up it tests that all the cryptographic algorithms operate correctly, and
that  sensitive  data  have  not  been  damaged.  Pre-operational  as  well  as  Conditional  Cryptographic
Algorithm  Self-tests  (CAST)  are  performed  on  each  power  up/boot  of  the  module  and  on  demand  by
power cycling the module (Perform self-tests (remote reset) service). The module performs a CAST for
ECDSA P-256 with SHA2-256 prior to executing the firmware integrity check on each boot.

The pre-operational firmware integrity test as well as all CASTs must be completed successfully prior to
any other use of cryptography by the module in the Approved mode of operation. These tests can also be
performed periodically by rebooting the module. If the pre-operation firmware integrity test or if any of
the CASTs fail, then the module returns the error indicator “FIPS error: self-test failure”, inhibits all data
output and enters the hard error state.

Conditional  Self-Tests  are  performed  by  the  module  when  the  corresponding  condition  is  met.  The
pairwise  consistency
in  signature
tests  are  performed  on  key  pair  generation
generation/verification (ECDSA and/or RSA tests) and/or for use in KAS-ECC SSP agreement (ECDSA tests).
The firmware load test is performed when a firmware image is loaded onto the module from an external
source. If the conditional self-tests fail, the module enters the soft error state, i.e., it rejects the generated
keypair/loaded image, returns an error indicator and resumes normal operation. The error indicator is the
return code -1 in case of a pairwise consistency test failure and “ERROR: Failed signature check” for the
firmware load test failure.

11.  Life-cycle Assurance

The Crypto Officer must follow the procedures defined below for secure installation, initialization, startup
and operation of the module.

Crypto Officer Guidance

The Crypto Officer must check to verify the firmware image being loaded on the module is the FIPS 140-3
validated version/image.  If the image is the FIPS 140-3 validated image, then proceed with installation of
the image.

Installing The Firmware Image

Download  the  validated  firmware  image  from  https://www.juniper.net/support/downloads/junos.html.
Log in to the Juniper Networks authentication system using the username (generally your e-mail address)
and  password  supplied  by  Juniper  Networks  representatives.  Select  the  validated  firmware  image.
Download the firmware image to a local host or to an internal software distribution site.

Connect to the console port on the device from your management device and log in to the Junos OS CLI.
Copy the firmware package to the device to the /var/tmp/ directory. Install the new package on the device
using the following command: operator@device> request vmhost software add /var/tmp/<package>.tgz.

NOTE: If you need to terminate the installation, do not reboot your device; instead, finish the installation
and  then  issue  the  request  system  software  delete  package.tgz  command,  where  package.tgz  is,  for
example, junos-vmhost-install-ptx-x86-64-22.4R2.8.tgz.This is your last chance to stop the installation.

Reboot the device to complete the load and start the installation:
operator@device> request vmhost reboot

After the reboot has completed, log in and use the show version command to verify that the new version
of the firmware is successfully installed.

Also install the built-in fips-mode.tgz package needed for enabling the Approved-mode and the jpfe-fips
package needed for execution of the CASTs. Please note that this is a one-time installation post which the
module remains in the Approved mode once enabled and automatically executes the CASTs on each boot
without requiring any operator or external intervention. The following are the commands used for installing
these packages:

operator@device >request system software add optional://fips-mode.tgz

operator@device >request system software add optional://jpfe-fips.tgz

Enabling Approved Mode of Operation

(Juniper Networks, Inc. © 2023)

Version 1.0
Public Material – May be reproduced only in its original entirety (without revision).

Page 44 of 47

The Crypto Officer is responsible for initializing the module in the Approved mode of operation. The
Approved mode of operation is not automatically enabled. The Crypto Officer shall place the module in
the Approved mode by first zeroising it to ensure no SSPs are present. Next, the cryptographic officer
shall follow the steps found in the Junos OS FIPS Evaluated Configuration Guide for PTX1000, Release
22.4R2 document Chapter 2 to place the module into an Approved mode of operation. The steps from
the aforementioned document have been reiterated below.

To enable the Approved mode in Junos OS on the module:

1.  Zeroise the module using the “request vmhost zeroize” command. Once the module comes up
in the “amnesiac mode” post zeroisation, connect to it using the console port with username
“root”, enter the configuration mode and configure the root-authentication password (i.e.,
Crypto Officer credentials) as follows:

root@device> edit
Entering configuration mode

[edit]

root@device# set system root-authentication plain-text-password
New password:

Retype new password:

[edit]

root@device# commit
configuration check succeeds
commit complete

2.  Enable Approved mode on the device by setting the Approved level to 1, and verify the level:

[edit]

root@device# set system fips level 1

[edit]

root@device# show system fips level
level 1;

4.  Commit the configuration

 'system' reboot is required to transition to fips level 1

                 commit complete

5.  Reboot the device:

 [edit]

root@device# run request system reboot

Reboot the system ? [yes,no] (no) yes

During the reboot, the device runs the pre-operational firmware integrity test and all
CASTs. It returns a login prompt as follows:

root@device:fips>

6.  After the reboot has completed, log in and use the show version command to verify the

firmware version is the validated version:

root@device:fips > show version

Placing the Module in the Non-Approved Mode of Operation

As Crypto Officer, the operator needs to disable the Approved mode of operation on the device to return
it to the non-Approved mode of operation. To disable the Approved mode on the device, the module must
be zeroised (step 1 defined above).

No other maintenance requirements apply for operation of the module in the Approved/non-Approved
modes as defined above. For further information and for the Administrator and non-Administrator
guidance, please see the Junos OS FIPS Evaluated Configuration Guide for PTX1000, Release 22.4R2
document.
