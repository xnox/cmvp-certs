Introduction
Federal Information Processing Standards Publication 140-3 — Security Requirements for Cryptographic Modules
specifies requirements for cryptographic modules to be deployed in a sensitive but unclassified (SBU) environment.
The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and Canadian Centre for Cyber Security (CCCS)
Cryptographic Module Validation Program (CMVP) run the FIPS 140-3 program. The National Voluntary Laboratory
Accreditation Program (NVLAP) provides accreditation to independent testing labs performing FIPS 140-3 testing; the
CMVP validates modules meeting FIPS 140-3 validation. Validated is the term given to a module that is documented
and tested against the FIPS 140-3 criteria.
More information is available on the CMVP website at: https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/cryptographic-module-
validation-program.

The module is validated at an Overall Security Level 3 with Physical Security at Level 4 and all other areas at Level 3.
The Operational Environment requirements do not apply to the module given that it meets Physical Security Level 4
requirements.

Cryptographic Boundary
The module is designed to be used as a part of a larger system. It works as an auxiliary security device attached
to a host controller. The physical form of the module is depicted in Figures 1 and 2 (to scale); the outline depicts
the cryptographic boundary, representing the surface of the chip and the bond pads. The red outline in Figure 3
also depicts the cryptographic boundary.

In production use, the module is delivered to either vendors or end user customers either on film frame carrier
(FFC) or various packages such as PDM1.1, NXD6.2, MOB6/10 or HVQFN20 package. The package is outside the
cryptographic boundary and thus excluded from the FIPS 140-3/ISO/IEC 19790 security testing.

The contactless ports of the module require connection to an antenna. The module relies on [ISO 7816]
and [ISO 14443] card readers as input/output devices, or a [NXP I2C] connection to a host controller.
No components have been excluded from within the cryptographic boundary.

Approved Mode of Operation
The module only supports an Approved mode of operation. The NXP SEMS Lite applet can support the NIST P-
256 curve or the vendor Approved and NIST allowed Brainpool256r1 elliptic curve to perform the ECDSA or KAS-
ECC operations. In the Approved mode of operation, the NXP SEMS Lite applet supports the Brainpool256r1
elliptic curve by default. The CO role may use SEMS Lite Module Management service to load NIST P-256 curve
parameters.

The P71D600 GlobalPlatform operational environment component can be identified by using the IDENTIFY APDU
command (Info service). This command returns the card identification data, which includes a Platform ID, a Patch
ID and other information that allows the identification of the content in ROM, NVM and loaded patches. The
Platform ID is a data string that allows the identification of the P71D600 Card Manager component.

The IDENTIFY APDU command is formatted as follows:

|     | Code  | Value            |                                         | Parameter settings  |     |
| --- | ----- | ---------------- | --------------------------------------- | ------------------- | --- |
|     | CLA   | ‘80’             | GlobalPlatform                          |                     |     |
|     | INS   | ‘CA’             | GET DATA (IDENTIFY) - ISD               |                     |     |
|     | P1    | ‘00’             | High order tag value                    |                     |     |
|     | P2    | ‘FE’             | Low order tag value - proprietary data  |                     |     |
|     | Lc    | ‘02’             | Length of data field                    |                     |     |
|     | Data  | ‘DF28’           | Module identification data              |                     |     |
|     | Le    | ‘00’             | Length of response data                 |                     |     |
|     |       | OneSpan NV 2025  |                                         | Version 1.0         |     |

The command answers the content of the DF28 file:
• Tag 02 identifies the Patch ID (see Table 2)
• Tag 03 identifies the Platform Build ID which is made up of the Platform ID (16 Bytes, see Table
2) and the platform build fingerprint (8 Bytes)
• Tag 08 identified the ROM ID (see Table 2)
To verify that the GlobalPlatform operational environment runs in the Approved mode of operation, use the
IDENTIFY APDU (as described above). The DF28 file tag ‘05’ contains the status of the Approved mode compliancy,
where ‘00’ identifies Approved mode not active and ‘01’ - Approved mode active.
Both NXP IoT applet and NXP SEMS Lite applet of the module are configured to always run in an Approved mode
of operation.
The personalized product shall have:
• NXP IoT applet v7.2.22 identification:
o Package ID: A00000039654530000000103000200H
o Applet ID: A0000003965453000000010300000000H
o Instance ID: A0000003965453000000010300000000H
• NXP SEMS Lite applet v2.0.2.11 identification:
o Package ID: A00000039654530000000103300000H
o Applet ID: A0000003965453000000010330000000H
o Instance ID: A0000003965453000000010330000000H
The operator can verify that NXP IoT applet v7.2.22 is in an Approved mode of operation by sending the two (2)
following commands to the module:
1. The SELECT APDU command (Context service) will be called with the following parameters: CLA =
00, INS = A4, P1 = 04, P2 = 00, Lc = 10, Incoming Data = A0000003965453000000010300000000,
and Le = 00. The module shall answer 07021626F2FFFF followed by status code 9000. The
response includes the BCD encoded applet version (070216) and the supported applet feature
bitmap (26F2). This encoded applet version (070216) corresponds to the decimal version v7.2.22
of the IoT Applet as specified in Table 2 in this document and the module certificate. It is not
possible in any way to modify the applet version or the supported features bitmap after the device
leaves the factory.
2. The GetVersion APDU command (IoT Applet Management service) shall be called to get the
extended feature bitmap. This command is 80040021 and shall return
26F20000011D81C1E101000E0000000F0F0F0F0F0F0F0F0F0F0F0F0F0F0F0F0F to be in Approved

version (02000211) corresponds to the decimal version v2.0.2.11 of the IoT Applet as specified in Table
2 in this document and the module certificate.
3. The GET DATA APDU command (SEMS Lite General service) shall be called with the following parameters:
CLA = 80, INS = CA, P1 = 00, P2 = C6, and Le = 00.
The command shall return C601019000 with C60101 indicating the NXP SEMS Lite applet is
configured in Approved mode of operation.
The module does not support a degraded operation.
In addition to the configurations tested by the laboratory, vendor-affirmed testing was performed on the following
platforms:
• SE052
• NCJ37
Note: The CMVP makes no statement as to the correct operation of the module or the security strengths of the
generated keys if the specific operational environment is not listed on the validation certificate.

The JavaCard and Global Platform APIs are internal interfaces available to applets. Only NXP applets and Card
Manager (ISD/SSD) services are available at the card edge (the interfaces that cross the cryptographic boundary).
The product is delivered with:
•  NXP IoT applet installed and configured before product’s delivery to customer. The end-user can
personalize the module with its objects but cannot modify the configuration of the module, the
Module always operates in an Approved mode of operation.
•  NXP SEMS Lite Applet installed and configured before product’s delivery to customer. The end-
user cannot modify the configuration of the module, the module always operates in an Approved
mode of operation. Thus, the end-user cannot bring unauthorized changes to the Approved
configuration of the module.

Overall Security Design and Rules of Operation
PBKDF Operation details
• Password strength
The password is stored in an APP-HMAC-KEY object as input to the PBKDF2 function. This key requires a minimum of
112 bits. The probability that a random attempt will end up with the same output is:
• 1/(2^112) = 1.9E-34 (using a minimum size for the password)
• Iteration Count and Justification
Iteration count should be at least 1000, following the recommendation in SP800-132r2.
If an application desires less iterations, the iteration count can be lower than 1000, but in any case, the iteration
count shall be 2 or more.
• Storage Only Statement
Output of PBKDF Operation service shall be used in storage applications.
AES GCM IV
The module enforces the use of an Approved DRBG in accordance with IG C.H scenario 2; the internal Approved
CTR_DRBG, which has a security strength of 128 bits, is used to generate the 96-bit IV.
TLS 1.2 Support
The module supports the TLS KDF Functions service. This service provides support for TLS v1.2 calculations. It does
not implement the TLS v1.2 protocol. Per FIPS 140-3 IG D.C, no parts of this protocol, other than the approved
cryptographic algorithms and the KDFs, have been tested by the CAVP and CMVP.

Authentication of each operator and their access to roles and services is as described below, independent of logical
channel usage (identity-based authentication methods implemented).
• Only one operator at a time is permitted on a channel.
• Applet de-selection (including Card Manager), card reset, or power down terminates the current
authentication. Re-authentication is required after any of these events for access to authenticated services.
• CO authentication method does not exchange plaintext CSP.
• User authentication data is encrypted and authenticated during entry with GlobalPlatform SCP03, is stored
encrypted with OS-MKEK and is only accessible by authenticated services. This includes user identifier (UserID)
in case of UserID session method.
Role Authentication Method Authentication Strength
CO SCP03 128 bits
User UserID Session 32 bits (minimum)
AESKey Session 128 bits
ECKey Session 128 bits
SEMS Lite Applet 128 bits
Table 7 – Roles and Authentication
Platform Authentication (Secure Channel Protocol 03 Authentication Method)
The Secure Channel Protocol authentication method is provided by the Secure Channel service. The SD-KENC and SD-
KMAC keys are used to derive the SD-SENC, SD-SMAC, and SD-RMAC session keys. These sessions keys are used with
AES-CBC and AES-CMAC to provide an end-to-end confidential and authenticated protected channel (Approved KTS)
between the external entity (User) and the module.
The external entity participating in the mutual authentication sends a 64-bit challenge to the Secure Element. The
Secure Element generates its own challenge and computes a 64-bit cryptogram with SD-SMAC key and both
challenges. The Secure Element cryptogram and challenge are sent to the external entity which checks the Secure
Element cryptogram and creates its own 64-bit cryptogram with both challenges. A 64-bit message authentication
code (MAC) is also computed on the command containing the external entity cryptogram with AES-CMAC and SD-
SMAC key. The MAC is concatenated to the command, and the command is sent to the Secure Element. The Secure
Element checks the message authentication code and compares the received cryptogram to the calculated
cryptogram. If all of this succeeds, the two participants are mutually authenticated (the external entity is
authenticated to the module).
The probability that a random attempt will succeed using this authentication method is:
• 1/(2^128) = 2.9E-39 (MAC||cryptogram) using a 128-bit block for authentication. This authentication
method includes a counter of failed authentication called “velocity checking” by GlobalPlatform. The
counter is decremented prior to any attempt to authenticate and is only reset to its threshold (maximum
value) upon successful authentication.
OneSpan NV 2025 Version 1.0

The module enforces a maximum of 60 failed Global Platform SCP03 authentication attempts before permanently
blocking the card. The probability that a random attempt will succeed over a one-minute interval is (with the
assumption here that one attempt is possible per second):
• 60/(2^128) = 1.7E-37 (MAC||cryptogram), using a 128-bit block for authentication
IoT applet Authentication
The applet allows creating an authenticated session using an Authentication Object which can be either UserID
session, AESKey session, or ECKey session.
An authenticated session allows users to protect and safeguard their credentials against third party use as only the
authenticated user has proper rights on the credentials. This is ensured by applying correct policies to the
credentials. A policy binds functional access to an Authentication Object where an Authentication Object represents
a user.
The different authentication methods are described in the sub-sections below.
UserID Session
An UserID session authentication method is provided by the Session management service.
During a UserID session, the session user identifier (UserID) is verified in order to allow setting up a session. If the
UserID is correct, the session establishment will succeed; otherwise, the session will not be opened.
An UserID can be configured from a minimum of four (4) bytes up to a maximum of 16 bytes (128 bits). In the worst-
case scenario, a 4-byte UserID is used, the probability that a random attempt will succeed using this authentication
method is:
• 1/(2^32) = 4.3E-9
The number of authentication attempts is configurable. It can be an infinite attempt number, or it can be limited by a
counter comprised between 1 and 255 attempts. A maximum of 4700 authentications can be performed in one
minute. In the worst-case scenario, the probability that a random attempt will succeed over a one-minute period is:
• 4700/(2^32) = 1.0E-6.
AESKey Session
The AESKey session authentication method is provided by the Session management service. The APP-AES-KEY-AUTH
key is used to derive the APP-SENC, APP-SMAC keys, and APP-RMAC. These sessions keys are used with AES-CBC and
AES-CMAC to provide an end-to-end confidential and authenticated protected channel (Approved KTS) between the
external entity (User) and the module.
The external entity participating in the mutual authentication sends a 64-bit challenge to the Secure Element. The
Secure Element generates its own challenge and computes a 64-bit cryptogram with APP-SMAC key and both

challenges. The Secure Element cryptogram and challenge are sent to the external entity which checks the Secure
Element cryptogram and creates its own 64-bit cryptogram with both challenges. A 64-bit message authentication
code (MAC) is also computed on the command containing the external entity cryptogram with AES-CMAC and APP-
SMAC key. The MAC is concatenated to the command, and the command is sent to the Secure Element. The Secure
Element checks the message authentication code and compares the received cryptogram to the calculated
cryptogram. If all of this succeeds, the two participants are mutually authenticated (the external entity is
authenticated to the module in the CO/User role).
The probability that a random attempt will succeed using this authentication method is:
• 1/(2^128) = 2.9E-39 (MAC||cryptogram, using a 128-bit block for authentication)
The number of authentication attempts is configurable. It can be an infinite attempt numbers or it can be limited by
a counter comprised between 1 and 32767. A maximum of 4700 authentications can be performed in one minute. In
the worst-case scenario, the probability that a random attempt will succeed over a one-minute period is:
• 4700/(2^128) = 1.3E-35 (MAC||cryptogram, using a 128-bit block for authentication).
ECKey Session
An ECKey session authentication method is provided by the Session management service.
The ECKey session authentication method consists of verifying a P-256 ECDSA signature. The P-256 EC public key is
either initially imported by the User (APP-EC-PUBLIC-KEY-USER) or provisioned during the manufacturing (APP-EC-
PUBLIC-KEY-CO). The user will own the corresponding ECDSA private key.
In addition to User’s authentication, ECKey session is used to establish
APP-KAS-IOT-SS/APP-KAS-SEMS-SS with the Approved KAS algorithm. The shared secret is used to derive the AES-128
APP-AES-KEY-AUTH which is itself used to derive the APP-SENC, APP-SMAC and APP-RMAC session keys. These
sessions keys are used with AES-CBC and AES-CMAC to provide an end-to-end confidential and authenticated
protected channel (Approved KTS) between the external entity (User) and the module.
First, the user requests the module public key, APP-KAS-SSC-EC-PUB-KEY; this key is signed with the private key APP-
KAS-SSC-EC-PRIV-KEY by the module. Then, the User sends the ephemeral KAS public key signed with User’s ECDSA
private key. Finally, the module verifies the ECDSA signature of the ephemeral key with either APP-EC-PUBLIC-KEY-
USER or APP-EC-PUBLIC-KEY-CO before initiating the KAS shared secret computation.
The probability that a random attempt will succeed using this authentication method is:
• 1/(2^128) = 2.9E-39 (using a 256-bit EC key for authentication)
The number of authentication attempts is configurable. It can be an infinite attempt numbers or it can be limited by
a counter comprised between 1 and 32767. A maximum of 4700 authentications can be performed in one minute. In
the worst-case scenario, the probability that a random attempt will succeed over a one-minute period is:
• 4700/(2^128) = 1.4E-35 (using a 256-bit EC key for authentication)

SEMS Lite Applet Authentication
The SEMS Lite applet is provided by the SEMS Lite Authentication service. The service provides authentication,
confidentiality, and integrity of each authenticated service. The SEMS Lite Applet authentication consists of verifying
a Brainpool256r1 ECDSA signature computed on a 113-byte data generated off the module and the CO public key
APP-ECC-RT-PUB-AUT, see section 5.1.4 of [GP] Amendment-I.
The probability that a random attempt will succeed using this authentication method is:
• 1/(2^128) = 2.9E-39 (using a 256-bit EC key for authentication)
To keep the SEMS Lite Applet from blocking, an infinite number of attempts is allowed. A maximum of 4700
authentications can be performed in one minute. In the worst-case scenario, the probability that a random attempt
will succeed over a one-minute period is:
• 4700/(2^128) = 1.4E-35 (using a 256-bit EC key for authentication)
The module does not support bypass or self-initiated cryptographic output capabilities.
The module is a limited operational environment under the FIPS 140-3 definitions. The module includes a
firmware load function to support necessary updates, but these are only limited to the vendor, OneSpan NV.
New firmware versions within the scope of this validation must be validated through the CMVP. Any other
firmware loaded into this module is out of the scope of this validation and requires a separate FIPS 140-3
validation.

5 Software/Firmware Security
The cryptographic module is considered a hardware module with firmware components. An error
detection code (32-bit CRC performed over all code located in Flash) is applied to all firmware
components within the module. If the integrity test fails, the module enters the hard error (MUTE)
state.
An operator of the module can perform the integrity test on demand with the GET DATA APDU
command. As a single-chip hardware module, the executable form of the code, i.e., firmware is binary
format. The module does not support loading of firmware from an external source.
ROM endurance has been proven to be more than 10 years after manufactured date. Therefore, per
FIPS 140-3 IG 5.A, no pre-operational ROM integrity self-test has been implemented. The module’s end-
of-life procedures must be applied prior to the degradation of the ROM by setting the module to the
TERMINATE state.
All data and control inputs, and data and status outputs of the cryptographic module and services are
directed through the module’s defined interfaces.

7  Physical Security

The module is a single-chip implementation that meets commercial-grade specifications for power,
temperature, reliability, and shock/vibrations. The module uses standard passivation techniques. The
module includes Environmental Failure Protection features such as temperature and voltage sensors.
Fault Induction mitigation techniques are light sensors and spike sensors on the supply voltage lines.
Identification of internal features such as sensitive components or interconnections is impeded by a fine
mesh of metal shield lines that resides at the outermost layers of the chip.
Delivery forms of the module are QFN package, contactless chip card module, or sawn wafer. Therefore,
the module does not rely on any physical security based on a package.

10 Self-Tests
On power-on or on demand, the module performs self-tests described below. The pre-operational self-test must be
completed successfully prior to any other use of cryptography by the module. The Cryptographic Algorithm Self-Tests
are either performed at boot or prior to first use. The conditional self-tests are performed when the corresponding
conditions occur. If one of the self-tests fails, the system is halted and will start again after a reset.
ROM endurance has been proven to be more than 10 years after manufactured date. Therefore, no pre-operational
ROM integrity self-test has been implemented. The module’s end-of-life procedures must be applied prior to the
degradation of the ROM by setting the module to the TERMINATE state, The Flash Firmware Integrity check is
performed on every reset or on demand.

parameters: CLA = 80, INS = CA, P1 = 00, P2 = FE, Lc = 04, Incoming Data = DF4B0120, and Le = 00. The expected
result is FE04DF4B0120. In case of a failure, the module enters a hard error (MUTE) state and returns a code/status
indicator. The APDU code 9000 signifies success and 66A7 is the error indicator corresponding to the MUTE error
state. The JCOP OS is intended to execute pre-operational self-tests (rather than conditional self- tests) periodically,
since these tests are pre-defined to be executed post resets. The periodic time will thus always start from zero. RAM
can be used to manage the periodic time interval which is the number of execution events e.g., number of
APDUs/commands received (the tests are repeated after every 500,000 CAPDUs/commands).

11 Life-Cycle Assurance
All configuration management items are managed using an automated configuration management system. The
module is designed to allow the testing of all provided security-related services. All firmware is implemented using a
high-level language and is designed in a manner that avoids the use of code, parameters, or symbols not necessary
for the module’s functionality and execution.
While the module can be delivered with the Approved mode enabled by default, customers also have the option to
receive a module which is in the unconfigured state, i.e., non-Approved mode. To comply with and maintain the FIPS
140-3 validation, it would be the CO’s responsibility to enable the Approved mode of operation as follows (this
information can also be found in the JCOP 4.5 User guidance and administrator manual document):
1. Install SEMS Lite applet to run in Approved mode of operation.
2. Install the IoT applet and configure the applet to run in Approved mode of operation.
3. Configure the Operation System to run in Approved mode of operation.
In each of these steps, it is in the CO’s responsibility to apply proper security conditions and to ensure that once the
device is put into Approved mode of operation, it will not be set into non-Approved mode of operation ever again.
The operator can verify that the module is operating in the Approved mode by following instructions specified in
Section 2 in this document.
There are no specific maintenance requirements for this module.

12 Mitigation of Other Attacks
The module is protected against the following non-invasive attacks: SPA, DPA, Timing Analysis and Fault Induction
using a combination of firmware and hardware countermeasures. Protection features include detection of out-of-
range supply voltages, frequencies or temperatures, fault induction mitigations like light sensors, voltage glitch
sensors and an active shield, and detection of illegal address or instruction.
All cryptographic computations and sensitive operations such as critical data comparison provided by the module are
designed to be resistant to timing and power analysis. Sensitive operations are performed in constant time,
regardless of the execution context (parameters, keys, etc.), owing to a combination of hardware and firmware
features. In addition to the non-invasive attacks, the module also uses standard passivation techniques and is
protected by active shielding (a grid of top metal layer wires with tamper response) which qualifies for classification
under mitigation of other attacks.
