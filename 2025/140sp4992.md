2.  Cryptographic Module Specification

The ACS is a multi-chip embedded cryptographic module. It consists of a secure hardware platform, a
firmware secure loader, and three separate microcontrollers, collectively called the Physical Security
Monitoring Control Unit (or PSMCU) The purpose of the cryptographic module is to load Approved
(RSA and ECDSA signed) application programs, called “personalities,” in a secure manner. The module
is in an Approved mode of operation until a personality is loaded and started, at which point the
module enters a non-compliant state.  Verification that the module is in Approved mode can be
observed by running the “getstatus” and “version” commands.

This security policy addresses only the hardware and the firmware secure loader; the personality is not
included in the current FIPS validation. But, the PCI-HSM version of the personality, as well as the
Loader are included in the PCI-HSM validation. This approach creates a common secure platform with
the ability to load trusted code (the personality).  Once control passes from the loader to a personality,
the module enters a non-compliant state.  Note that the PSMCU is always running and no personality,
no matter what its FIPS 140-3 validation level, will have access to the module’s secret keys and CSPs.

3.  Cryptographic Module Interfaces

3.1 External Ports

There are four physical data paths into and out of the ACS.

•  LED (Qty. 64) – used to provide continuous status of the module. The LEDs are physically
mounted on the printed circuit board.  There are 4 groups of 16 LEDs that are directly
controlled by 4 different hardware components.  The first is the PSMCU, which secures the top
level cryptographic keys and provides the interface to the Octeon CPU core.  The second and
third are the CMS microcontrollers which control and monitor the various power supplies and
environmental conditions.  Finally, the Octeon CPU core running the Loader has the final 16
LEDs, of which 6 are externally visible along the back edge connector that can be seen from the
rear of the unit.  There are also two other LEDs visible on the rear edge connector, one from the
PSMCU and one for the network link and activity for the RJ45 Ethernet port. The RJ45 Ethernet
port is disabled and not used by the Loader and the RJ45 Activity LED is turned off. A diagram of
the physical placement of the LEDs is shown in the figure below and a description of the LEDs is
given in in the table below.

•  RJ45 Ethernet (Qty. 1), compatible with 10/100 Base T IEEE 802.3. – Not used by the loader and

not in the scope of this document.
•  Serial port. This is standard RS-232.
•  PCIe. This interface is the primary interface used to send commands and data to, and receive

status from, the ACS. In addition, this is the primary power connection to the ACS.

The following table shows the relationships among the physical and logical ports:

Note: No SSPs of any type are output from the module under any condition. The data which is output is
of informational nature, such as version numbers, command return codes and error messages, etc.

3.2 Power

Primary main system power is derived from the 3.3V pins on the PCIe connector.  The supplies derived
from the 3.3V pins are

•  Nitrox 1.8V (PLL, VPH & VPTX)
•  External printer interface (LPT)
•  CMS main power
•  Octeon PCIe 1.5V supply
•  Octeon DDR4 memory supplies (2.5V, 1.2V and 0.6V)

In addition to the power from the PCIe connector there is an additional power connector on the right
side of the board. This connector provides 12V that is used solely to provide the CORE (0.9V) power for
the Octeon through a step down regulator.

Also, on the PCIe connector there is a 3.3Vaux supply pin that provides standby power to the two CMS
chips as well as the PSMCU. This power is present whenever the HOST has power available regardless
of whether it is turned on or not.

Finally, there is a battery supply input that provides power to the PSMCU to maintain perimeter
penetration detection and security keys when neither the 3.3V or 3.3Vaux power from the HOST is
available.

The power requirements are:

4.1 Roles

4.1.1  Unauthenticated Role

An unauthenticated role has access to services as specified in Table 9. These services fall under
Exception “e” (show status, show version, and self-tests) or Additional Comment 5 (zeroization) from
FIPS 140-3 IG 4.1.A.

4.1.2  Crypto Officer Role

A Crypto Officer is responsible for the overall security of the module. Only an operator in the Crypto
Officer role can load a personality into the ACS.

4.1.3   User Role

A User can perform a limited number of the services available on the module as indicated in the
following section.

The ACS supports identity-based authentication of operators.  The operator’s identity is represented by
public key stored on behalf of the respective operator.  Signing with the corresponding private key
authenticates the operator.  Note that the module is only able to store four operator identities – one
capable of assuming the Crypto Officer (CO) and the other three capable of assuming the User role for
one of the three different personality modes.

The Crypto Officer role is far more security relevant than the User role from the FIPS perspective, so
authentication for a Crypto Officer requires a significantly longer key.

4.3.1  Crypto Officer

A Crypto Officer is required to be properly authenticated and its authentication mechanism is
controlled by the PSK (private key) and PECSK (private key), which are used to sign personality images,
and the LSK (private key) and LECSK (private key) (not SSP’s), which are used to sign the Loader
firmware. A CO uses his knowledge of the PSK (private key) and PECSK (private key) to create signed
personality images for download to the unit. Similarly, the CO uses his knowledge of the LSK (private

key) and LECSK (private key) to create signed loader images. A 4096-bit RSA key and a P-521 ECDSA
private key shall be used for the authentication process.

4.3.2  User Authentication

A User is required to be properly authenticated and his authentication mechanism is controlled by the
GSK (private key), which is used to sign the ‘go’ command for each of the three personality types. A
User uses his knowledge of the GSK (private key) to sign either the ‘go’ command, the ‘go-pci’
command, or the ‘go-fips” command which allows the Loader to exit and start a personality of the
same designated type. The User’s authentication key is a 2048-bit RSA key.

Authentication Strength

256 bits;
(RSA) Authentication is performed using RSA 4096 /w SHA-512
signatures (provides 152 bits of strength). The probability that a
random attempt will succeed, or a false acceptance will occur, is
approximately 1 in 2^152, which is less than 1 in 1,000,000. The
command authentication takes approximately 1 second to
complete. Therefore a maximum of 60 authentication attempts can
be made per minute. Based on this maximum rate, the probability
that a random attempt will succeed in a one-minute period is
approximately 60 in 2^152, which is less than 1 in 100,000.

(ECDSA) Authentication is performed using ECDSA P-521 /w SHA-
512 signatures (provides 256 bits of strength). The probability that
a random attempt will succeed, or a false acceptance will occur, is
approximately 1 in 2^256, which is less than 1 in 1,000,000. The
command authentication takes approximately 1 second to
complete. Therefore a maximum of 60 authentication attempts can
be made per minute. Based on this maximum rate, the probability
that a random attempt will succeed in a one-minute period is
approximately 60 in 2^256, which is less than 1 in 100,000.
112 bits;
Authentication is performed using RSA 2048 /w SHA-512 signatures
(provides 112 bits of strength). The probability that a random
attempt will succeed, or a false acceptance will occur, is
approximately 1 in 2^112, which is less than 1 in 1,000,000. The
command authentication takes approximately 1 second to
complete. Therefore a maximum of 60 authentication attempts can
be made per minute. Based on this maximum rate, the probability
that a random attempt will succeed in a one-minute period is
approximately 60 in 2^112, which is less than 1 in 100,000.

The firmware integrity tests can be invoked on-demand by power-cycling the module. The required
CASTs are executed for the RSA and ECDSA approved integrity techniques prior to the execution of the
firmware integrity test. Please refer to Section 2.10 of this document for more information.

6.  Operational Environment

Not Applicable. The module has a limited operational environment and is validated with Physical
Security Level 3.

7.  Physical Security

The embodiment of the ACS is of a multi-chip embedded module.

The Physical Security and Security Control Unit (PSMCU) within the ACS continually monitors the
physical security of the module for attempts to physically penetrate the cryptographic boundary.

Depending on states of (PSMCU) two major events are generated within the secured boundary of the
module.

1.  A "reset event" is one that forces the module to become temporarily inoperable.  This is a non-
catastrophic event.  When the conditions that cause the "reset event" are removed the unit will
operate.

2.  A "tamper event" is one that forces the module to become permanently disabled.  This is a

catastrophic event.  In the disabled state all critical security parameters are erased and the module
can only provide status information to users.  Any physical penetration results in a “tamper event”.
This event causes active zeroization of all cleartext CSPs.

The following table specifies the required actions required by the operator to ensure the physical
security of the ACS is maintained.

Atalla Cryptographic Subsystem
Non-Proprietary Security Policy
Events are signals that are generated by hardware circuits that monitor the physical environment.
There are no actions required by the operator to enable the monitoring of the physical environment.
There is no method for the operator to disable the monitoring of the physical environment.

When events have occurred, the unit becomes non-operational either by going into the permanent
ALARM state or the temporary RESET state.
The detected events are:

•  Physical penetration - the secure boundary has been penetrated or otherwise broken. This

event shall happen also by grid, switch, and signal level detection mechanisms.

•  Battery low - the battery output voltage that powers the physical detectors and maintains
Critical Security Parameters falls below or increases above of the normal operating voltage
established for this circuitry.

•  Voltage out of limits - the host system voltage is outside of the normal operating range.
•  Thermal out of limits 1 - the module temperature is outside of the normal operating range

while operating on external power.

•  Thermal out of limits 2 – the module temperature is outside operational limits of components

while operating on battery power only.

•  Card removal detection event – the ACS is removed from the host. This event is not

catastrophic but rather warning event. The module is up and running but not functioning (in
suspend mode) and requires the “resume” command from the authorized personnel, which will
reset the flag.

Details

The DRBG requests 1024-bits of output from the entropy source. The
entropy source provides 0.31515540348 bits of entropy per bit of
output from the vetted Conditioning Component Block Cipher
Derivation Function SP 800-90B (A2606). Therefore the DRBG is
seeded with at least 322 bits of entropy before generating keys.

10. Self-Tests

The following self-tests are performed automatically by the module without requiring operator
intervention.

1.  Pre-operational self-tests

a.  Pre-operational software/firmware integrity test:

i.  Firmware Integrity Test: The integrity of the Loader is verified at startup by

checking a 4096-bit RSA signature and ECDSA P-521 signature.Stage 1, Stage
2, and Boot are verified by CRC-32. PSMCU, CMS-OCT, and CMS-NTX are
verified by a 64-bit EDC. All must be verified successfully to continue

b.  Pre-operational critical functions test:

i.  Memory: Done during DDR RAM initialization
ii.  Key Integrity Check: All Loader keys are stored encrypted using CCM. The key
CCM MAC is used to verify integrity before these keys are used. All PSMCU
CSPs are stored within the PSMCU in cleartext form use leftmost 16-bytes of
SHA-512 hash as the check digits. The check digits are used to verify integrity
before these keys are used.

2.  Conditional self-tests

a.  Conditional cryptographic algorithm test

i.  SHA2-512 hash - Known answer test
ii.  AES-ECB 256-bit Encrypt – Known answer test (ECB is only used for self-tests)
iii.  AES-ECB 256-bit Decrypt – Known answer test (ECB is only used for self-tests)
iv.  AES-CBC 256-bit Encrypt – Known answer test
v.  AES-CBC 256-bit Decrypt – Known answer test
vi.  RSA SigVer (FIPS 186-4) 4096-bit modulus with SHA2-512 - Known answer test
vii.  ECDSA SigVer (FIPS 186-4) P-521 with SHA2-512 - Known answer test
viii.  SP800-90Arev1 Counter DRBG (instantiate/generate/reseed) – Known answer

test

ix.  SP800-90B ENT (P) Self-Test- 4096 entropy samples generated with

continuous health-tests (APT and RCT) enabled.
x.  AES -CCM 256-bit Encrypt – Known Answer Test
xi.  AES -CCM 256-bit Decrypt – Known Answer Test
xii.  Continuous SP800-90B ENT (P) Health Tests (APT and RCT).
xiii.  Continuous SP800-90Arev1 DRBG periodic self-tests

(Instantiate/Generate/Reseed).

b.  Conditional software/firmware load test:

i.  Firmware Load Test: This is a series of tests used to validate the integrity of

the Loader firmware or personality when loaded into the module. These tests
include CCM for secure and authenticated key transport, Signature test (RSA
4096-bit modulus and ECDSA P-521 curve both with SHA-512), AES-256 file
decryption, and CRC-32 for simple integrity check.

c.  Conditional critical functions test:

i.  “go” command personality start validation: The “go” command is

authenticated using a 2048-bit signature. Following this, the personality
integrity is validated with CRC-32, then decrypted using AES-256, then
validated again by verifying its signatures (RSA 4096-bit modulus and ECDSA
P-521 curve both with SHA-512), prior to passing control to it.

Failure of any of the above tests results in an error state. Recovery from the error state requires power
cycling. When an error state occurs, cryptographic operations (like “go”, personality load, etc.) are
disabled until the error state has been rectified.

Since the module is only powered-on for short periods of time (30-60 seconds to start a personality, 3-
4 minutes to update flash) self-tests are periodically performed by nature of the design (i.e. power-on
self-tests, conditional self-tests, and signature tests on every start of the card).  The only time the
loader remains active for more than a couple minutes is if the ACS card has tampered or entered test
state, in which case it is prevented from doing any cryptographic or security-related operations,
permanently, so there is no need for periodic self-tests, in this case.

In addition to the automatic self-tests, the module supports cryptographic algorithm self-test services
(<algorithm> Test). These services allow the user to request on-demand invocation of any specific test.
Additionally, the user can invoke all of the self-tests on demand by power-cycling the module.

11. Life-cycle Assurance

The module is always in an Approved mode of operation until a personality is loaded and started, at
which point the module enters a non-compliant state. The ACS loads and generates its initial keys
randomly in manufacturing in the factory, during the process of entering into secure state. Once secure
state has been entered, the physical security monitoring of external penetration, and voltage/thermal
operating conditions are continuously maintained by the PSMCU, which is battery and system
powered.  The monitoring is maintained for the entire ACS life cycle.  During normal operational use of
the cryptographic operations, any failed startup test or self-test will enter a state that does not allow
any cryptographic operations to be completed without cycling the power to the ACS.  If an event is
detected that results in the ACS security boundary being compromised, all keys are erased immediately
and the ACS enters Tampered State, which renders the device cryptographic operations unusable,
ending the ACS life cycle.  There is no means to recover from this state, without irreversible damage.

HSM lifecycle is documented and located within the HSM security directory and available upon
request.

12. Mitigation of Other Attacks

The module does not implement any additional attack mitigation techniques.
