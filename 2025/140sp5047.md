2.4. Approved mode of operation
The cryptographic module supports an approved and non-approved mode of operation. The module defaults to the
approved mode of operation as long as the guidance outlined in Section 11 is followed, and operator can verify that the
module enters the default approved mode by confirming that the version is consistent with the version information
described in this Security Policy. The module will transition between the approved and non-approved modes depending on
the services requested by the operator. The operator can check whether the module is in the approved mode or the non-
approved mode via status response from each service. The module zeroises SSPs when completing a service as described
in Table 10, however it is recommended for the Crypto Officer (CO) via procedural guidance set forth in this Security Policy
to also perform a power reset to zeroise all SSPs of the module when switching between modes of operation.

4.3.  Authentication
The module supports role-based authentication that requires authentication to assume for the authorization of each role.

FIPS 140-3 Non-Proprietary Security Policy for Samsung TCG Opal SSC Cryptographic Sub-Chip

Probability of 1/2192 in a single random attempt.
FL ECDSA signature verification
Probability of 1250/2192 in multiple random attempts in a one-minute.
Table 12. Roles and Authentication
Table 9 shows each authentication method and strength for a single and multiple attempts.
The CO role requires password-based authentication, where each byte can be any of 0x00 to 0xFF. Each password
authentication failure holds the cryptographic module for 750ms. This restricts the maximum attempts for a one-minute to
less than 80 attempts (60,000ms/750ms).
The User role requires password-based authentication, where each byte can be any of 0x00 to 0xFF. Each password
authentication failure holds the cryptographic module for 750ms. This restricts the maximum attempts for a one-minute to
less than 80 attempts (60,000ms/750ms).
The FL role is limited to authenticate functions that verifies 2 steps of ECDSA P-384 with SHA-384 digital signature of firmware
to complete a login. The firmware signed6 by Samsung is authenticated by verifying the ECDSA signature which has 192
security strength in every power-on. Each signature verification attempt takes at least 48ms. This can be enforced with up to
1,250 attempts in a minute.
6 The signing key is securely stored in HSM which is under Samsung internal development management.

FIPS 140-3 Non-Proprietary Security Policy for Samsung TCG Opal SSC Cryptographic Sub-Chip

5. Software/Firmware security
- The module applies digital signature verification using ECDSA-384 with SHA-384 for firmware integrity test.
-
The firmware integrity test is performed every power on reset.
Page 18 of 29
FIPS 140-3 Non-Proprietary Security Policy for Samsung TCG Opal SSC Cryptographic Sub-Chip

6. Operational environment
- The cryptographic module operates in limited operational environment that consists of the module’s firmware. This
operational environment does not require any specific security rules, settings/configurations or restrictions to be set.
- The cryptographic module does not provide any general-purpose operating system to the operator.
- Firmware loading is allowed only for CMVP validated firmware versions. Unauthorized modification of the firmware is
prevented by the pre-operational firmware integrity test and conditional firmware load test.

7. Physical security
The following physical security mechanisms are implemented in a cryptographic module itself:
• All components are manufactured to production-grade with standard passivation.
• Encased in opaque package within the visible spectrum.
• Apply strong removal-resistant and penetration resistant IC packaging technique.
The following table summarizes the actions required by the Crypto Officer Role to ensure that physical security is maintained:
Physical Security Recommended Frequency
Inspection/Test Guidance Details
Mechanisms of Inspection/Test
Inspect the entire perimeter whether gathering of
Opaque covering internal components are visible.
Stop the service if tampering is found.
Inspect the damage such as removing epoxy
As often as feasible
overfill, separation from the PCB of the silicon die,
Tamper evident
solder ball deterioration (diameter, pitch)
IC packaging
No functioning normally if tampering is found.
Stop the service.

-  Temporary SSPs are zeroised when power on reset.
-  Firmware integrity temporary values are zeroised after the firmware integrity test is complete.
-  The zeroisation is performed before overwriting the target SSP with random value which is generated from the DRBG
-  The AES-GCM IV is generated by the module and complies with FIPS 140-3 IG C.H technique 2. The IV is 96 bits in length,
and its generated by the SP 800-90Arev1 DRBG internal to the module’s boundary.

7 Because there is no non-volatile storage in this module without OTP, basically, automatic zeroisation runs instantly either when temporary SSP
as well as SSPs are no longer needed after key generation/use, or every power-on-reset depending on characteristics of volatile memory.
8 List only methods by running the approved service in 10 of the operator.
9 The values of V and Key are the critical values of the internal state.
10 Approved DRBG SSPs reside only inside the hardware DRBG IP and there is no way for operator to access and handle.
11 The PIN is also known as a Password in the context of this document. The terms are interchangeable.

10. Self-tests
While executing the following self-tests, all data output is inhibited until the self-test is completed. To execute the pre-
operational tests on-demand, the operator may run the power-cycle of the module. If the self-test fails, the module enters
an error state. The module has two error states.
The "Rom Mode" error state is entered when the module fails the pre-operational self-test (Firmware integrity test) or the
conditional self-test (Firmware load test). The error indicator output by the module is "eSROMReturn_VerifyFail".
The "FIPS Fail Mode" error state is entered when the module fails any other conditional self-test (Cryptographic algorithm
self-test or Pair-wise consistency test). The error indicator output is "0x4C494146".
All data output is inhibited during the self-test and error states.

11. Life-cycle assurance
The followings describe the security rules for secure initialization and operation which the cryptographic module and Crypto
Officer shall be enforced under FIPS 140-3 security level 2 compliant manner:
11.1. Secure Initialization
[Step 1] Execute the firmware loading into the module
[Step 2] Execute Init and Open method
[Step 3] Replace the default password via Set_CPIN service if first-time authentication.
- Identify the status indicator via Show Status service in the Table 7.
- Identify that response information matches the versioning information in Table 3.
11.2. Operational description of module
• The cryptographic module shall maintain logical separation of data input, data output, control input, control output, and
power.
• The cryptographic module shall enforce a limited operational environment by the secure firmware load test using ECDSA
p-384 with SHA-384.
• The cryptographic module enters the error state upon failure of Self-tests. All commands are rejected in the error state
with exception of the Show Status service. Cryptographic services and data output are explicitly inhibited in the error
state.
• The module generates at a minimum 256 bits of entropy for use in key generation.
• Bypass capability is not applicable to the cryptographic module
• The module generates symmetric keys that are unmodified outputs from the DRBG.
11.3. Administrator Guidance
The Crypto officer shall power up the module and call the “Show Status” service to verify the following output is provided.
This confirms that the SoC is running a FIPS validated module that has booted successfully passing the pre-operational self-
tests.
• - Tested Configuration: S4LY011A01
• - Hardware Version: S02
• - Firmware Version: SS0200
11.4. Non-Administrator Guidance
The module generates GCM IV internally in compliance with scenario 2 of IG C.H. The IV length is 96 bits, and the IV value is
obtained from the SP 800-90ARev1 approved DRBG implemented by the module.
