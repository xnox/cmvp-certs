2  Cryptographic module specification
The Module is a Hardware cryptographic module, as defined by [ISO19790]. The module consists of the
Belmar ASIC for performing AES-256 XTS mode encryption and decryption for User data, and a firmware
component  to  provide  self-test  functionality.  For  XTS  mode,  encrypt  and  decrypt  operations  are
symmetric,  thus  the  module  is  one  logical  block.  Furthermore,  the  AES-256  XTS  mode  encryption  and
decryption can only be used for storage of User data.

The Module is intended for use by US Federal agencies or other markets that require FIPS 140-3 validated
Data Storage.

The physical form of the Module is depicted in Figure 2. The cryptographic boundary is the single-chip
Flash Controller, including an XTS-AES-256 hardware block in the Direct Memory Access engine, as well
as a firmware component running on the ASIC. This component is responsible for loading the AES key
into the cryptographic hardware and running the Self-Tests. Data is encrypted while being transported
by the DMA engine into the drive and decrypted by the engine on the way out. The diagram below
shows the flow of data through the module.

algorithm available to operators.

2.1  Mode of Operation

The Module only supports an Approved mode of operation. To verify that a module is in the Approved
mode of operation and that the FIPS validated version is being used, the operator must check the version
output using the “Show Status” service and compare it against the FIPS certificate.

3  Cryptographic Module Interfaces

The data enters and exits the module via the memory subsystem. There are two ports to the memory
subsystem, one from the PCIe interface, and one from the DDR interface, which are connected to the
DMA hardware engine.

For  the  firmware  portion  of  the  module,  the  logical  interfaces  are  the  application  program  interfaces
(APIs)  through  which  commands  are  issued  to  the  flash  controller  firmware.  The  flash  controller  itself
communicates using the NVMe over PCIe protocol. The five interfaces which are used in the cryptographic
module are specified in Table 3 below.

4  Role, services, and authentication

The Module supports two distinct operator roles, Cryptographic Officer (CO) and User. The cryptographic
module uses implicit mapping between services and roles to enforce the separation of roles.

The Module does not implement authentication. The Module does not support a maintenance role. The
Module does not support concurrent operators.

5  Software/Firmware security

The Module uses CRC16 to implement the integrity test. This integrity test can be run on demand using
the “Run self-test” service API provided by the Module, or by power cycling the Module. The integrity test

Version 1.2

is  run  automatically  on  power  up  and  before  the  module  is  operational,  and  if  the  test  fails  then  the
Module will not enter an operational state.

The firmware itself is executed as a BIN executable. The Belmar ASIC has 16 separate cores, each which
runs  a  respective  binary.  The  binary  is  constructed  from  an  ELF  executable,  and  similarly  consists  of
sections which are given a loading address and section size. Each section is loaded into memory in the
Secondary Boot Loader during the boot process.

6  Operational Environment

The Module has a non-modifiable operational environment under the FIPS 140-3 definitions. Firmware
versions validated through  the  FIPS 140-3  CMVP will  be  explicitly  identified  on a validation  certificate,
along with the Belmar ASIC model number. Any firmware or hardware not identified in this Security Policy
does not constitute the Module defined by this Security Policy or covered by this validation.

7  Physical Security Policy

The  Module,  which  has  a single-chip  embodiment,  meets  the  FIPS  140-3  requirements  for  production
grade components and standard passivation. The PMC Flashtec NVMe 2016 Controller Chip (referred to
as the Belmar ASIC) the module consists of is produced for high performance enterprise workloads.

8  Non-invasive security

Not Applicable. The module does not support non-invasive attack security.

9  Sensitive Security Parameter Management

All  SSPs  used  by  the  Module  are  described  in  this  section.  All  usage  of  these SSPs  by  the  Module  are
described in the services detailed in Section 4. The SSPs are kept in volatile write-only registers in the
Module, and all intermediate values used for loading SSPs are zeroized immediately after use.

9.1  Zeroization

All SSPs managed by the module are stored in volatile memory. The Crypto-office can zeroize all SSPs by:

●
●

removing power from the module, or
invoking the 'reset module' service.

10  Self-tests

Each time the Module is powered on it will perform self-tests to ensure its proper operation.  Per FIPS
140-3 these are categorized as either pre-operational self-tests or conditional self-tests.  Pre-operational
self–tests are available on demand by power cycling the module, or through an API call. Conditional self-
tests  are  available  through  an  API  call.  All  cryptographic  algorithm  self-tests  (CASTs)  must  complete
successfully prior to any other use of cryptography by the Module.

The Module performs the following pre-operational self-tests.

●  Firmware Integrity: CRC16 EDC of the firmware component, performed within the cryptographic

boundary over the whole binary

The Module performs the following conditional cryptographic algorithm self-tests:

●  AES-XTS-256 Encrypt/Decrypt KAT

The Module performs the following conditional critical function self-tests:

●  XTS Duplicate key test - during key initialization the module checks that XTS key1 does not equal

key2 and fails to load the key if this condition is not satisfied (IG C.I XTS-AES).

All pre-operational self-tests must be completed successfully prior to any other use of cryptography by
the Module. The only pre-operational test for the Module is the integrity test. If the integrity test fails,
then the firmware will fail to start the Belmar ASIC, prohibiting any read or write operations. The drive
will return a CRC_CHECK_FAILED code and control input will not be allowed.

To  become  operational,  the  AES  KAT  test  must  be  run.  This  will  be  run  automatically  during  the  “key
initialization service” or can be run manually through the “run self-test” service. If the AES KAT test fails,
the  Module  enters  the  KAT_ERROR  error  state,  and  the  output  of  the  “Show  Status”  service  will  be
kat_test_passed=TEST_FAILED.

Upon power-up, a user can read the self-test status through the "Show Status” service to determine the
status of the self-tests.

If the module is in the error state, then all cryptographic functions will be disabled, and a power cycle is
required to get out of the error state.

Below are the possible ways to enter the error state, and the accompanying status indicators:

●

Integrity Test Failed

○

integrity_test_status=TEST_FAILED

●  AES KAT Test Failed

○  kat_test_status=TEST_FAILED

●  Key Initialization Failed

○  key_init_status=TEST_FAILED

11  Life-cycle Assurance

11.1  General requirements

The FlashBlade Data Encryption Module is integrated into Pure Storage Inc. storage products and is
not delivered on its own as a standalone product. Pure Storage Inc.’s internal development process
guarantees that the correct version of module goes with its intended products.

11.2  Crypto Officer Guidance

The  module  is  configured  to  be  operational  by  default.  If  the  Flash  Controller  Chip  starts  up
successfully and has successfully passed the Self-tests detailed in Section 10, it is operating correctly
and can begin servicing requests.

All the functions, ports and logical interfaces described in this document are implicitly available to
the Crypto Officer and User roles. The module only provides approved functions, and as such there
are no special procedures to configure or administer the approved mode of operation. There are no
requirements for non-administrator operators.
The operator can  verify that  the  module  is in  the  Approved  mode  of  operation  and  that the FIPS
validated version is being used, by checking the version output using the "Show Status" service. This
is performed by invoking the 'wssdtool dump' command. The output will include the following:

Chip version: NVMe2016.B1
Firmware Version: 2.10.27

11.3  End of Life

When decommissioning the Flash Controller Chip a reset of the power will sanitize all SSPs in the
module (the AES-XTS keys).

12  Mitigation of Other Attacks Policy

Not Applicable. The module does not support mitigation of other attacks.
