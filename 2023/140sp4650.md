Section 2 – Cryptographic Module Specification
KIOXIA FIPS TC58NC1132GTC Crypto Sub-Chip (listed in Section2.1 Product Version) is used
for solid state drive data security. The CM is a single chip hardware module implemented as a
sub-chip compliant with IG 2.3.B in the TC58NC1132GTC 0003 SoC (see Figure 1 in Section 7).
Overall Security Rating of the CM is Level2 (See Table 1 in Section 1 for individual security area
levels). The CM is embedded in TCG Enterprise compliant solid state drive controllers which
provides user data encryption/decryption through build-in HW engines. The CM is responsible
for providing key management, access control of stored user data, and various cryptographic
algorithm for the solid state drive.
The CM has multiple cryptographic services using approved algorithms, but they do not support
the degraded operation. The physical boundary of the CM is the TC58NC1132GTC 0003 SoC and
the logical boundary of the CM is TC58NC1132GTC CRPT module.
The CM has one approved mode of operation and CM is always in approved mode of operation
after initial operations are performed (See Section 11). In approved mode, the CM provides
services defined in Table 7 in Section 4.2.

The CM performs role authentication by comparing whether the PIN entered by the user
matches the information stored inside the CM. PINs are hashed with SHA-256 to store them on
the CM. The PIN entered by the user is hashed and compared to the stored PIN hash.
PINs can be changed by executing the Set PIN Service (see Section4.2) with appropriate roles
authenticated. The CM refuses to set a PIN less than 8 bytes, and responds with an error if such
64
a setting is attempted. Therefore, the probability that a random attempt will succeed is 1 / 2
< 1 / 1,000,000 (the CM accepts any value (0x00-0xFF) as each byte of PIN). The CM waits
2sec when authentication attempt fails, so the maximum number of authentication attempts is
30 times in 1 min. Consequently, the probability that random attempts in 1min will succeed is
| 30 / 2 64  < 1 / 100,000.  |     |     |     |     |     |     |

Section 5 – Software/Firmware Security
Firmware Security of components in this CM is shown below.
ROM Code:
・ Form of the executable code: ELF format
・ Integrity verification method: 32bit CRC
・ Method for integrity test on demand: Power cycling
Firmware image (User Code):
・ Form of the executable code: ELF format
・ Integrity verification method: Approved signature verification (see table 3)

Section 6 – Operational Environment
Operational Environment requirements are not applicable because the CM does not employ
operating systems and operates in a non-modifiable environment that is the CM cannot be
modified and no code can be added or deleted.
Section 7 – Physical Security
The CM is a sub-chip enclosed in a single chip that is an opaque package. Gathering information
of the moduleʼs internal construction or components is impossible without forcing the package
to open. In this case, it is confirmed package damage as a tamper-evidence. Operators of the
CM can ensure that the physical security is maintained to confirm the package has no obvious
attack damage. If the operator discovers tamper evidence, the CM should be removed.

The Entropy Source is a hardware module inside the CM boundary. The Entropy Source
supplies the Hash_DRBG with 512 bits entropy input. From Table 10 this input contains about
404 bits of entropy, which is sufficient entropy to obtain 256 bits of security strength.
13 Oct 27, 2023

For the Entropy Source listed in the table above, self-tests are performed each time before data
is obtained (see Section 10 for details of these self-tests). When these tests detect that the
Entropy Source cannot generate the sufficient amount of entropy, the CM is transient to error
state. The CM can be recovered from the error state by rebooting the module, and the obtaining
of Entropy data is attempted again. If the CM continuously enters in error state in spite of
several trials of reboot, the CM may be sent back to factory to recover from error state.

Table 11 - Self Tests

As shown in the table above, self-tests are performed automatically at the CM startup and
before execution certain security functions. Operator can also initiate self-test on-demand for
periodic testing by using the Reset service which is automatically invoked when the module is
powered-off and powered-on (rebooted).
If the self-tests fail, the CM reports error status and enters to the error state. In this case, the
CM must be powered-off to clear error condition. When power-on is executed again, self-tests
are also executed like an on-demand operator reset. If the CM continuously enters in error state
in spite of several trials of reboot, the CM may be sent back to factory to recover from error
state.

Section 11 – Life-cycle Assurance
In the SSDʼs manufacturing process, installation is executed as below:

8 Firmware load test  is also run at the time of Power-up, and the integrity of the Firmware
loaded into the CM can be confirmed.

1. The Firmware described in Section 2.1 is downloaded into the CM.
2. Initial SSPs are generated.
3. Initial authentication information is set to the CM.
4. System area including SSPs generated in Step2 and Step3 are encrypted and calculated
message authentication code.
Initial operations to setup this CM are following:
1. Load Firmware into the CM.
2. Load System area including SSPs into the CM.
3. Execute Range state setting method.
4. Execute Download port setting method.
The CM switches to approved mode after the initial operation success. When the initial
operation succeeds, the CM indicates success on the Status Output interface. Users can confirm
that the CM is in approved mode by executing Show Status service and checking that the
startup is successfully completed. As described in Section 2, the CM is used by being embedded
in the solid state drive. Therefore, there are no maintenance requirements for the CM alone.
Guidance for this module is provided to solid state drive developers who embed the CM. The
usage and maintenance of solid state drives with the CM built-in are outside of the scope of this
document.
Section 12 – Mitigation of Other Attacks
The CM does not mitigate other attacks beyond the scope of FIPS 140-3 requirements.
